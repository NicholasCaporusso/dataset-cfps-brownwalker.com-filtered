In parallel, the requirements of the competent authorities towards the exhaustive collection and management of any adverse events related to the products marketed by the Marketing Authorisation Holders (MAH) are becoming more and more tight in order to better guarantee that the safety of the patients using the products is the highest standard. As an additional fact, the use of social media and the Internet have brought to game table agents that were not used to fulfill or to even know the pharmacovigilance standards required to the Pharmaceutical Industry. As a result of this the role of Pharmacovigilance has become key to correctly address a series of activities (electronic surveys, chats, chatrooms, etc.) and players (Product Managers, Communications Managers, Community Managers) in order to guarantee that all Legal requirements are met.","date_start":"2021-09-14","date_end":"2021-09-16","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Medicine & Health","Pharmaceutical / Medicinal"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Online Event","Hungary"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Online Event","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Hungary"},"organizers":["GLC Europe"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
