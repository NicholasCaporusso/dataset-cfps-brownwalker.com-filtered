{"name":"Intersecting Spaces, Mobility, and Language in the ‘Uncommon Community’","series":"","short":"","website":"https://www.buffalo.edu/nemla/convention.html","content":"The notion of “community” sometimes centers unquestioningly on whatever it is shared by a given group of people without pausing to study the emergence of the uncommon, the disparate or the disjointed among its members. Thus, certain practices underlying distinctiveness, differentiation, and separation are manifested in ways that may become as equally meaningful to them as their common cultural, political, religious, material, and any other structures, values, and characteristics representing them and their community. The session seeks to bring together submissions that examine how real and imagined spaces, mobility, and language contribute to the formation of “uncommon communities,\" and how these are represented and expressed individually and communally in works of fiction, popular culture, and ethnography. Papers that examine the significance of the various usages of space, mobility, and language, and their crisscrossing in influencing the “uncommon community” from more than one perspective such as literary theory, cultural geography, sociolinguistics, discourse analysis, and other related disciplines will be considered for inclusion in the panel.
