Further, the conference considers as essential the link to Services Science, acknowledging the service-orientation in most current IT-driven collaborations. The conference is nevertheless not about the union of these two (already broad) fields, but about Cloud Computing where we are also interested in how Services Science can provide theory, methods and techniques to design, analyze, manage, market and study various aspects of Cloud Computing. CONFERENCE AREAS: Each of these topic areas is expanded below but the sub-topics list is not exhaustive. Papers may address one or more of the listed sub-topics, although authors should not feel limited by them. Unlisted but related sub-topics are also acceptable, provided they fit in one of the following main topic areas: 1\\. SERVICES SCIENCE 2\\. DATA AS A SERVICE 3\\. CLOUD OPERATIONS AND ANALYTICS 4\\. MOBILE CLOUD COMPUTING 5\\. EDGE CLOUD AND FOG COMPUTING 6\\. SERVICE MODELLING AND ANALYTICS 7\\. CLOUD COMPUTING FUNDAMENTALS 8\\. CLOUD COMPUTING PLATFORMS AND APPLICATIONS 9\\.
