{"name":"Urban Spaces And The Queer Experience","series":"","short":"","website":"https://www.cfplist.com/nemla/Home/S/16895","content":"Navigating urban spaces as a queer subject in a global world can prove to be challenging. Indeed, the experience of being queer in the cité, favela or any major urban space around the globe may conjure up a different reality based on the subject’s country and society. This panel will consider the way writers, filmmakers, and intellectuals view queers and their relationship with the urban spaces they inhabit, especially cities implicated in postcoloniality, globalization, and nationalism and that struggle with tradition and modernity, religious faith and secularism, political upheavals and economic crises. Proposals for paper presentation on Beur Literature, Francophone Literature, Urban Literature , Comparative Literature, Media Studies and other disciplines are welcome. Please specify if A/V equipment will be required.","date_start":"2018-04-12","date_end":"2018-04-15","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2017-09-30","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Arts & Humanities","Languages/Literature"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Pittsburgh","Pennsylvania","United States"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Pittsburgh","state":"Pennsylvania","ZIP":"","country":"United States"},"organizers":["NeMLA 2018"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
