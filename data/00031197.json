{"name":"\"Place of Memory and the Memory of Place\" International Conference","series":"","short":"","website":"https://memory.lcir.co.uk","content":"Memory is a major theme in contemporary life, a key to personal, social and cultural identity. Scholars have studied the concept from different perspectives and within different disciplines: philosophy, sociology, anthropology, geography, architecture, urban design, and the interdisciplinary \"place studies\". According to Pierre Nora, places of memory or lieux de m√©moire refer to those places where \"memory crystallizes and secretes itself\"; the places where the exhausted capital of collective memory condenses and is expressed. To be considered as such, these sites must be definable in the three senses of the word: material, symbolical and functional, all in different degrees but always present. What makes them a memory site is the interplay of memory and history, the interaction of both factors, which allows their reciprocal over-determination. \"The Place of Memory and the Memory of Place\" International Conference aims to spark new conversations across the field of memory and place studies. Paper proposals up to 250 words should be sent to: memory@lcir.co.uk.","date_start":"2023-06-17","date_end":"2023-06-18","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2023-03-05","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Arts & Humanities","Philosophy","interdisciplinary"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Oxford/Online","United Kingdom"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Oxford/Online","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"United Kingdom"},"organizers":["LCIR"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":["memory@lcir.co.uk"]}
