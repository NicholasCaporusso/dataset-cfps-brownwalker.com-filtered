{"name":"4th International Conference on Trends in Material Science and Inventive Materials ICTMIM 2022","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.ictiie.com/2022","content":"The fundamental discoveries made in materials science domain have substantially increased the mankind's ability to modify matter. The fundamental properties, processing, and advanced applications of micro/nanostructured materials have initiated a rapidly growing interest among the materials science communities. Presently, the advanced and intelligent materials are the most promising trends due to their unique properties. In addition, smart electronic materials have a very high innovation potential for the utilization in numerous practical applications. In this way, the 4 th International Conference on Trends in Material Science and Inventive Materials \\[ICTMIM 2022\\] establishes a platform to discuss and collect together the novel research ideas leading to new innovations from a fundamental point of view and real-time applications and in many cases it utilizes the novel functionalities. 4 th ICTMIM 2022 has planned to discuss the challenges in realizing the smart electronic materials with functionally significant properties that are attractive for innovative real-time applications. The conference also welcomes the discussion on new approaches to establish composition-structure-properties and the possibility of using the obtained data for solving the materials science challenges.","date_start":"2022-03-24","date_end":"2022-03-25","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2022-03-11","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Electrical/ Electronic"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Coimbatore","India"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Coimbatore","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"India"},"organizers":["JCT College of Engineering and Technology, Coimbatore"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
