Technology is progressing at a very fast pace, which currently is weighing heavily on the earth's bounty of natural resources and causing serious damage to the environment. The price for this large-scale and mass expansion in all forms of daily life is being paid for in the form of climate change. Today, dangerous pollution levels and global environmental degradation endangers the very existence of life on our planet. Now, more than ever, there is an urgent need for professionals from all sectors of engineering and science to come together and work together to find sustainable solutions to sustain economic growth without harming the environment in any way whatsoever.","date_start":"2022-05-26","date_end":"2022-05-27","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2022-01-30","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Electrical/ Electronic","Sustainable Development and Engineering"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Kuala Lumpur","Malaysia"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Kuala Lumpur","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Malaysia"},"organizers":["INSTITUTE FOR ENGINEERING RESEARCH AND PUBLICATION (IFERP)"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
