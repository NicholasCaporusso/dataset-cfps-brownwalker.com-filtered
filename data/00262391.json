{"name":"International Conference on Computational Creativity – Extended CFP","series":"","short":"","website":"https://computationalcreativity.net/iccc24","content":"The International Conference on Computational Creativity is the premier forum for disseminating research on computational and AI creativity, bringing together researchers interested in exploring the ever increasing capacities of technology in creative domains such as writing, visual arts and music. State-of-the-art AI-algorithms can now create works that to a casual observer are comparable to those of human professionals, but many have questioned whether this is sufficient (or even necessary) for a computer to be considered to be “acting creatively”. This conference and its associated workshops exist to discuss the how and what of computational participation in creativity.","date_start":"2024-06-17","date_end":"2024-06-21","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2024-02-28","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics","Computer Science","Interdisciplinary"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Jönköping","Sweden"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Jönköping","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Sweden"},"organizers":["Association for Computational Creativity"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
