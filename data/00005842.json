{"name":"In the beginning was the word … and then … technology","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.assenglish.org/wt","content":"In the recent decades, technology has advanced to a tremendous speed that it is so difficult to keep pace with it. The applications of technology in the field of communication but not only are manifold to the point that they have transformed and redefined many aspects of human life. Whilst on the one hand, these have facilitated life in general and human communication in particular, they have also brought the need to revisit several concepts and ideas related primarily to them. If once communication was first and dictated developments in technology, it can now be claimed that technology comes first and dictates the way we communicate. Although the applications of technology are countless, the conference seeks to particularly explore the intersections between word and technology, that is, to trace all possible applications of technology in language, literature and culture. We invite scholars to join us in the reconsideration of past and present relations of word and technology from the twenty-first century perspective.","date_start":"2015-11-26","date_end":"2015-11-28","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2015-07-15","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Arts & Humanities","Languages/Literature","computational linguistics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Tirana","Albania"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Tirana","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Albania"},"organizers":[""],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
