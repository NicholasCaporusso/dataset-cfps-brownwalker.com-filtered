{"name":"International Conference on Augmented Intelligence and Sustainable Systems ICAISS-2022","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.icaiss.in","content":"Augmented Intelligence plays a significant role in automating the everyday activities of human lives. Augmented Intelligence not only creates new opportunities but also results in developing greater challenges in establishing the sustainable engineering applications. Augmented Intelligence assists the next generation real-time applications to reduce their environment and societal impact by improving the efficiency and developing new real-time models. Therefore, the further research exploration on understanding the relationship between augmented intelligence and sustainable systems will help to develop next-generation applications. To prioritize sustainable development, augmented intelligence is considered as a massive technological boost. Sustainability is the greatest challenge in a variety of areas like artificial intelligence, augmented/virtual reality, robotics, IoT, agriculture, health, transportation, etc. It is believed that augmented intelligence, data analytics and data science have significant roles to play in evidence based systems to support sustainability, as well as providing a tool to continuously monitor and achieve the sustainable engineering goals.","date_start":"2022-11-24","date_end":"2022-11-26","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2022-11-10","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Electrical/ Electronic","Artificial intelligence"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Tiruchirappalli","India"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Tiruchirappalli","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"India"},"organizers":["CARE College of Engineering, Trichy, India"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
