A number of evolutionary computational models have been proposed, including evolutionary algorithms, genetic algorithms, the evolution strategy, evolutionary programming, swarm intelligence and artificial life. This conference intends to be a major forum for scientists, engineers and practitioners interested in the study, analysis, design, modeling and implementation of evolvable systems, both theoretically and in a broad range of application fields. ECTA welcomes both theoretical research and practical applications. The conference also aims to foster hybrid approaches within evolutionary computation and also involving fuzzy computation and neural computation. Conference Topics:  Genetic Algorithms  Machine Learning  Cognitive Systems  Artificial Life  Representation Techniques  Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization  Game Theory and Applications  Evolution Strategies  Evolutionary Robotics and Intelligent Agents  Society and Cultural Aspects of Evolution  Concurrent Co-operation  Co-evolution and Collective Behavior  Biocomputing and Complex Adaptive Systems  Bio-inspired Hardware and Networks  Swarm/Collective Intelligence  Evolutionary Art and Design  Hybrid Systems  Memetic Algorithms IJCCI KEYNOTE SPEAKERS Julian Togelius, Center for Computer Games Research, IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark Yaochu Jin, University of Surrey, United Kingdom IJCCI CONFERENCE CHAIR Joaquim Filipe, Polytechnic Institute of Setúbal / INSTICC, Portugal PROGRAM CO-CHAIRS Agostinho Rosa, IST, Portugal Juan Julian Merelo, University of Granada, Spain PROGRAM COMMITTEE http://www.ecta.ijcci.org/ProgramCommittee.aspx ECTA Secretariat Address: Av.
