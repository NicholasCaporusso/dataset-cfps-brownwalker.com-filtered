{"name":"9th Annual International Conference on Computer Science Education: Innovation & Technology- CSEIT 2018","series":"","short":"","website":"http://cseducation.org/index.html","content":"Currently, computer science educators share educational material, but this process is unstructured and does not shared material for effective use. Current sharing of material takes the form of open access to uploaded lectures on Youtube, design models and source code on websites, and informal collaboration between local groups of educators. There is a need for identifying global commonalities in computer science curricula and establishing a framework of program/course outcomes that links to associated topics and material for teaching and assessment at the undergraduate level of university education. Such a proposed environment of sharable material will have applicability beyond small collaborative groups through broad-based international voluntary collaborative groups.","date_start":"2018-10-22","date_end":"2018-10-23","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2018-04-20","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics","Information technology systems (IT)"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Singapore","Singapore"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Singapore","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Singapore"},"organizers":["Global Science and technology Forum"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
