{"name":"Design of Experiments for Chemists and Engineers","series":"","short":"","website":"https://go.evvnt.com/616405-3?pid=4868","content":"Industrial Scientists can no longer afford to experiment in a trial-and-error manner, changing one factor at a time. A far more effective method is to apply a systematic approach to experimentation that considers all factors simultaneously. This approach is called Design of Experiments (DoE) and many scientists use it as an efficient way to solve serious problems afflicting their projects. DoE provides information about the interaction of factors and the way the total system works, something not obtainable through traditional testing methods. DoE also shows how interconnected factors respond over a wide range of values, without requiring the testing of all possible values directly. DoE is a fundamental aspect of Quality by Design. The two day course is written and presented by a process chemist with extensive experience of applying DoE across a wide range of chemical reactions from reaction screening and new route development through to reaction optimisation and scale up. The course will empower scientists to implement DoE in their work to more efficiently improve their processes.
