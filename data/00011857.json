{"name":"4th International Symposium on Enhanced Landfill Mining","series":"","short":"","website":"http://elfm.eu","content":"Following the success of the first three Enhanced Landfill Mining Symposia in 2010 (Belgium), 2013 (Belgium) and 2016 (Portugal), the Fourth International Symposium on Enhanced Landfill Mining (ELFM IV) is held in 2018 (February 5-7) in Belgium. The Symposium is organised in the framework of the EURELCO network (European Enhanced Landfill Mining Consortium) and the MSCA-ETN NEW-MINE project (EU Horizon 2020 Marie-Sklodowska Curie European Training Network NEW-MINE). The science/technology part of the Symposium (ELFM IV) is organised in Mechelen (February 5-6). ELFM IV provides the floor to a host of both Invited Speakers (with keynote lectures/papers) and Regular Speakers (through a call for papers) to shed light on the recent progress in both the technological and non-technological aspects of ELFM within the wider circular economy context. Several Invited Speakers provide review/position papers on the status of key ELFM domains, such as geophysical methods for landfill exploration, state-of-the-art sorting technologies, solar and plasma gasification, multi-criteria assessment results of ELFM projects etc. As such the audience receives a comprehensive overview of the wide ELFM research and innovation domain. Invited speakers and participants involve both leading academics, industrial affiliates, governmental representatives and civil society actors, respecting the multi-actor, “quadruple helix” approach endorsed by the EURELCO Consortium.","date_start":"2018-02-05","date_end":"2018-02-07","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2017-05-30","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Mining/Mineral"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Mechelen","Belgium"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Mechelen","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Belgium"},"organizers":[""],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
