{"name":"London Studies: Women Walking in the City Workshop","series":"","short":"","website":"https://londonstudies.lcir.co.uk/workshop","content":"Women Walking in the City Workshop 24 November 2019 London Centre for Interdisciplinary Research Inspired by the journey of Virignia Woolf’s Mrs Dalloway and Lauren Elkin’s critical work Flaneuse, this one-day workshop seeks to explore the idiosyncratic journey of various women in the city of London as represented in British fiction. The course will focus on the idea of women in public space and think about the ways in which the city provides women new freedoms to think, to explore and to be. We will look at work by Virginia Woolf, Muriel Spark and Anita Brookner and discuss representations of the city landscape in specific texts. We will also engage with some theories and ideas of the city in modernism and critical theory. The workshop will start at 9am and finish at 1pm and it will include three sessions and two coffee breaks: 9:00-10:20 Session 1: Virginia Woolf 10:30-11:50 Session 2: Muriel Spark 12:00-13:00 Session 3: Anita Brookner In order to book a place, please register on http://registration.lcir.co.uk Registration fee is 65 GBP.
