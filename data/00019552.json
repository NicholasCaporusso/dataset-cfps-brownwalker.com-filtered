{"name":"2019 Power Plant Simulation Conference","series":"","short":"","website":"http://scs.org/powerplant","content":"The 2019 Power Plant Simulation Conference (PowerPlantSimâ€™19) is an annual conference sponsored by The Society for Modeling and Simulation International (SCS). This conference focuses on the special needs of the nuclear and fossil power plant simulation community and includes presentations by technology and industry leaders, technical sessions, panel and roundtable discussions, and vendor exhibits. The primary goal of the conference is to promote open exchange of simulator related information between all attendees. Topics of interest include but are not limited to: Simulator Modifications Simulator Upgrades Virtual Simulator Technology Non-Training Uses of Power Plant Simulators Knowledge Retention/Succession Planning Life Cycle Management of Simulator Components Emulated Stimulator Technology Simulator Oversight & Management Regulations Hardware Upgrades Glass Panel Simulator Usage Simulator Support Systems (Audio/Video/UPS/HVAC, etc.). All individuals associated with the maintenance, management, training, regulation, or application of nuclear and fossil power plant simulators are encouraged to attend and/or participate by simulating original presentations. Utility personnel associated with the maintenance, management, training, regulation, or application of nuclear and fossil power plant simulators are encouraged to attend and/or participate by submitting original presentations.","date_start":"2019-01-20","date_end":"2019-01-23","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2018-11-15","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Renewable Energy/Nuclear","Energy Engineering"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Tampa","United States"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Tampa","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"United States"},"organizers":["The Society for Modeling and Simulation International (SCS)"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
