We have gathered together invited speakers from around the world, who you might not otherwise have access to. This international event will discuss new cellular, molecular and chemical approaches to improving immunisation efficacy. Who Should Attend: This event is aimed at those working in all aspects of vaccine research and development, including but not limited to those involved in academic and pharmaceutical R&D, and clinicians with an interest in vaccination. We encourage questions, discussion and debate and have a relaxed atmosphere which generates maximum interaction online. After registration you will be connected to an online networking site where you will be able to have discussions with all participants of this event, before, during and after the meeting. The event will be recorded and available for all registered delegates up to a month after the event. So if you canâ€™t manage all the days, or the different time zones, you can still have access to the full event.","date_start":"2016-10-25","date_end":"2016-10-27","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2016-10-25","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Medicine & Health","Medical-Speciality"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Online Event",""],"name":"","street":"","city":"Online Event","state":"","ZIP":"","country":""},"organizers":[""],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
