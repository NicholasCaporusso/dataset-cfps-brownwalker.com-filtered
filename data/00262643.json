The program features distinguished keynote speakers in addition to short, cutting-edge talks covering a range of topics in chemical biology. A committee of experts selects the short talk presenters from abstract submissions. The meeting will also feature a poster session. Submit a poster session or short talk by April 14, 2024 and be part of a dynamic conference program at the forefront of chemical biology research. Researchers at all levels and across disciplines and sectors can advance their work in a relatively small and relaxed venue designed to foster dynamic dialogues â€“ propelling their research, and the science, forward. Poster presenter opportunities are reserved exclusively for graduate students and post-docs.
