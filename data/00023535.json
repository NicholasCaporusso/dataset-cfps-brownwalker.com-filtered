{"name":"12th International Conference on Computer Supported Education - CSEDU 2020","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.csedu.org","content":"CSEDU 2020, the International Conference on Computer Supported Education, is a yearly meeting place for presenting and discussing new educational tools and environments, best practices and case studies on innovative technology-based learning strategies, and institutional policies on computer supported education including open and distance education. CSEDU 2020 will provide an overview of current technologies as well as upcoming trends, and promote discussion about the pedagogical potential of new educational technologies in the academic and corporate world. CSEDU seeks papers and posters describing educational technology research; academic or business case-studies; or advanced prototypes, systems, tools, and techniques. \n Full research reports (regular papers) and work-in-progress reports (position papers) are welcome, as well as general survey papers discussing future directions. Suggested topics are listed below in the section, â€œConference Areas.\" Papers not falling into these topics may also be acceptable at the discretion of the program chairs. All papers must describe original work not previously published or submitted to another conference. Acceptance will be based on quality, relevance, and originality. Accepted papers, presented at the conference by one or more of the authors, will be published in the Proceedings of CSEDU under an ISBN and indexed by major indexes. \n CSEDU will also host special sessions dedicated to case-studies and commercial presentations, as well as tutorials dedicated to technical/scientific topics. Companies interested in presenting their products/methodologies or researchers interested in holding a tutorial, workshop, or special session are invited to contact the conference secretariat or visit the conference website. \n Conference Topics: \n Area 1: Artificial Intelligence in Education \n \\- Adaptive Educational Systems \n \\- Intelligent Teacher Dashboards \n \\- Intelligent Modelling \n \\- Authoring Tools for Intelligent Tutoring Systems \n \\- Learning with AI Systems \n \\- Agent-Based Learning Environments \n \\- Architectures for AI-based Educational Systems \n \\- Machine Learning \n \\- Big Data for Education \n \\- Pedagogical Agents \n \\- Natural Language Processing \n Area 2: Domain Applications and Case Studies \n \\- eLearning Case Studies \n \\- Health Sector Applications \n \\- Intelligent Learning and Teaching Systems \n \\- Pre-K/K-12 Education \n Area 3: Information Technologies Supporting Learning \n \\- Authoring Tools and Content Development \n \\- Virtual and Augmented Learning Environments \n \\- Synchronous and Asynchronous Learning \n \\- Educational Data Mining \n \\- Classroom Management \n \\- eLearning Hardware and Software \n \\- eLearning Platforms, Portals \n \\- Tools for Educational Communication and Collaboration \n \\- Intelligent Tutoring Systems \n \\- Learning Analytics \n Area 4: Learning/Teaching Methodologies and Assessment \n \\- Tools to Assess Learning \n \\- Instructional Design \n \\- Mentoring and Tutoring \n \\- Metrics and Performance Measurement \n \\- Project Based Learning and Engineering Education \n \\- Blended Learning \n \\- Faculty Development \n \\- Game-Based and Simulation-Based Learning \n \\- Higher Order Thinking Skills \n \\- Immersive Learning \n \\- Flipped Classroom \n Area 5: Social Context and Learning Environments \n \\- Assessment and Accreditation of Courses and Institutions \n \\- Lifelong Learning: Continuing Professional Training and Development \n \\- Theoretical Bases of eLearning Environments \n \\- Social Computing for Learning and Knowledge Sharing \n \\- Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning \n \\- Community Building \n \\- Vocational Training \n \\- Course Design and eLearning Curriculae \n \\- Active Learning \n \\- Constructivism and Social Constructivism \n Area 6: Ubiquitous Learning \n \\- Universal Design for Learning \n \\- Cloud-Based Learning and Assessment \n \\- Distance Education \n \\- Mobile Learning (M-Learning) \n \\- Virtual Labs and Virtual Classrooms \n \\- Massive Open Online Courses ","date_start":"2020-05-02","date_end":"2020-05-04","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2019-12-13","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Prague","Czech Republic"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Prague","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Czech Republic"},"organizers":["INSTICC"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
