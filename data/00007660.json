{"name":"Pacific Conference on Statistical Computing and Data Mining","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.thinksisu.org/statistical-computing","content":"Prior to the ready availability of powerful computers, insights from data analysis were limited by reliance on small but manageable data samples and by techniques derived from mathematical theory that relied upon stringent but often unrealistic assumptions. Neither constraint applies today. Today the focus is on “Big Data”, computer-intensive strategies that substitute raw computing power for abstract theory, and new algorithms to explore hidden and often unforeseen patterns in data. We encourage presentations that introduce and demonstrate novel approaches to data analysis, that glean fresh insights from data, or that compare methods.","date_start":"2016-05-06","date_end":"2016-05-08","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2016-04-01","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Physical Science & Math","Statistics/Probability","Statistics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Palm Springs","California","United States"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Palm Springs","state":"California","ZIP":"","country":"United States"},"organizers":["The sisu Advantage"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
