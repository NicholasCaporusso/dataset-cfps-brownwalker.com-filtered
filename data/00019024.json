{"name":"Mechanisms and Non-Linear Problems of Nucleation and Growth of Crystals and Thin Films","series":"","short":"","website":"http://mgctf.ru","content":"The international conference on theoretical, experimental and numerical studies of nucleation and growth of crystals and thin films (http://mgctf.ru) will take place at Saint-Petersburg Scientific Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences on July 1–5, 2019\\. The topics include the fundamental problems of phase transitions, nonlinear and collective phenomena during crystal growth, physics, chemistry, mechanics of crystal surfaces, lattice defects. The works concerning wide-bandgap semiconductors are especially welcome. Participants can give a plenary lecture (35 minutes), an oral presentation (20 minutes) or a poster. The deadline for submitting abstracts (up to 3,500 characters with spaces) is April 1, 2019\\. Full-length articles based on the conference materials will be published in a special issue of the journal “Physics of the Solid State” (impact factor 0.925). Registration and other organizational details are available on the conference website.","date_start":"2019-07-01","date_end":"2019-07-05","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2019-04-01","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Physical Science & Math","Physics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Saint","Petersburg","Russian Federation"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Saint","state":"Petersburg","ZIP":"","country":"Russian Federation"},"organizers":["Russian Foundation for Basic Research"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
