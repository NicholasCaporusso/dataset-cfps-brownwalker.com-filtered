{"name":"15th International Conference on Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software Engineering - ENASE 2020","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.enase.org","content":"The mission of ENASE (Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software Engineering) is to be a prime international forum to discuss and publish research findings and IT industry experiences with relation to novel approaches to software engineering. The conference acknowledges evolution in systems and software thinking due to contemporary shifts of computing paradigm to e-services, cloud computing, mobile connectivity, business processes, and societal participation. By publishing the latest research on novel approaches to software engineering and by evaluating them against systems and software quality criteria, ENASE conferences advance knowledge and research in software engineering, including and emphasizing service-oriented, business-process driven, and ubiquitous mobile computing. ENASE aims at identifying most hopeful trends and proposing new directions for consideration by researchers and practitioners involved in large-scale systems and software development, integration, deployment, delivery, maintenance and evolution. \n Conference Topics: \n Area 1: Service Science and Business Information Systems \n \\- Cloud Computing \n \\- Business Process Management and Engineering \n \\- Data & Process Mining \n \\- Collaborative Software Engineering \n \\- Delivery, Deployment and Maintenance of Service Systems \n \\- Document and Workflow Management \n \\- Knowledge Management and Engineering \n \\- Software and System Interoperability \n \\- Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) \n \\- Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Quality of Service (QoS) \n \\- Software and Service Design \n \\- Enterprise Systems \n \\- Systems and Service Analysis and Design \n \\- Software and Service Maintenance and Evolution \n \\- Service Discovery and Composition \n \\- E-Commerce and Mobile Commerce \n Area 2: Software Engineering \n \\- Agile, Aspect-Oriented and Agent-Oriented Software Engineering \n \\- Application Integration Technologies \n \\- Architectural Design and Frameworks \n \\- Big Data and Software Engineering \n \\- Component-Based Software Engineering \n \\- Design Thinking \n \\- Empirical Software Engineering \n \\- Formal Methods \n \\- Frameworks and Middleware \n \\- Meta Programming Systems and Meta Modeling \n \\- Model-Driven Engineering \n \\- Requirements Engineering \n \\- Reverse Software Engineering \n \\- Software and System Complexity \n \\- Software and Systems Development Methodologies \n \\- Software and System Quality Management \n \\- Software Change and Configuration Management \n \\- Software Engineering for Cyber-physical Systems \n \\- Software Engineering for Emerging Domains \n \\- Software Metrics \n \\- Software Patterns and Refactoring \n \\- Software Product Line Engineering \n \\- Software Process Improvement \n \\- Service-Oriented Software Engineering \n \\- User-Centered Software Engineering ","date_start":"2020-05-05","date_end":"2020-05-06","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2019-12-13","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Prague","Czech Republic"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Prague","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Czech Republic"},"organizers":["INSTICC"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
