{"name":"16th International Conference on Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotics - ICINCO 2019","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.icinco.org/ ","content":"The purpose of the 16th International Conference on Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotics (ICINCO) is to bring together researchers, engineers and practitioners interested in the application of informatics to Control, Automation and Robotics. Four simultaneous tracks will be held, covering Intelligent Control Systems, Optimization, Robotics, Automation, Signal Processing, Sensors, Systems Modelling and Control, and Industrial Informatics. \n Informatics applications are pervasive in many areas of Control, Automation and Robotics; This conference intends to emphasize this connection, therefore, authors should highlight the benefits of Information Technology (IT) in these areas. Ideas on how to solve problems using IT, both in R&D and industrial applications, are welcome. Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques and general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Papers describing original work are invited in any of the areas listed below. Accepted papers, presented at the conference by one of the authors, will be published in the Proceedings of ICINCO, with an ISBN. Acceptance will be based on quality, relevance and originality. Both full research reports and work-in-progress reports are welcome. There will be both oral and poster sessions \n Special sessions, dedicated to case-studies and commercial presentations, as well as tutorials dedicated to technical/scientific topics are also envisaged: companies interested in presenting their products/methodologies or researchers interested in holding a tutorial, workshop or special session are invited to contact the conference secretariat or visit the conference website. \n Conference Topics: \n Area 1: Intelligent Control Systems and Optimization \n \\- Decision Support Systems \n \\- Distributed Control Systems \n \\- Engineering Applications on Intelligent Control Systems and Optimization \n \\- Evolutionary Computation and Control \n \\- Fuzzy Control \n \\- Genetic Algorithms \n \\- Hybrid Learning Systems \n \\- Intelligent Fault Detection, Diagnosis and Prognostics \n \\- Knowledge-Based Systems Applications \n \\- Machine Learning in Control Applications \n \\- Neural Networks Based Control Systems \n \\- Optimization Algorithms \n \\- Planning and Scheduling \n \\- Soft Computing \n \\- Software Agents for Intelligent Control Systems \n Area 2: Robotics and Automation \n \\- Autonomous Agents \n \\- Cognitive Approach for Robotics \n \\- Collective and Social Robots \n \\- Control and Supervision Systems \n \\- Engineering Applications on Robotics and Automation \n \\- Guidance, Navigation and Control \n \\- Human-Machine Interfaces \n \\- Humanoid Robots \n \\- Human-Robots Interfaces \n \\- Image Processing \n \\- Industrial Networks and Automation \n \\- Intelligent Transportation Technologies and Systems \n \\- Mechatronics Systems \n \\- Mobile Robots and Intelligent Autonomous Systems \n \\- Modelling, Simulation and Architecture \n \\- Network Robotics \n \\- Perception and Awareness \n \\- Robot Design, Development and Control \n \\- Space and Underwater Robots \n \\- Surveillance, Fault Detection and Diagnosis \n \\- Telerobotics and Teleoperation \n \\- Vehicle Control Applications \n \\- Virtual Environment, Virtual and Augmented Reality \n \\- Vision, Recognition and Reconstruction \n Area 3: Signal Processing, Sensors, Systems Modelling and Control \n \\- Adaptive Signal Processing and Control \n \\- Biological Inspired Sensors \n \\- Computer and Microprocessor-Based Control \n \\- Defect and Change Detection and Identification \n \\- Engineering Applications \n \\- Environmental Monitoring and Control \n \\- Information-Based Models for Control \n \\- Intelligent Components for Control \n \\- Mechanical, Force and Tactile Sensors \n \\- Modelling, Analysis and Control of Discrete-Event Systems \n \\- Modelling, Analysis and Control of Hybrid Dynamical Systems \n \\- Nonlinear Signals and Systems \n \\- Optimization Problems in Signal Processing \n \\- Real-Time Systems Control \n \\- Sensors Fusion \n \\- Signal Reconstruction \n \\- System Identification \n \\- System Modelling \n \\- Time-Frequency Analysis \n Area 4: Industrial Informatics \n \\- Computer-Based Manufacturing Technologies \n \\- Energy Efficiency and Green Manufacturing \n \\- Human Factors & Human-System Interface \n \\- Industrial Automation and Robotics \n \\- Industrial Internet of Things \n \\- Intelligent Design and Manufacturing \n \\- Manufacturing Systems Engineering \n \\- Performance Evaluation and Optimization \n \\- Precision Engineering \n \\- Production Planning, Scheduling and Control \n \\- Production Tasks' Design, Planning and Management \n \\- Quality Control and Management \n \\- Resources and Knowledge Management in Industry \n \\- Supply Chain and Logistics Engineering \n \\- Systems Modelling and Simulation ","date_start":"2019-07-29","date_end":"2019-07-31","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2019-06-05","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Prague","Czech Republic"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Prague","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Czech Republic"},"organizers":["INSTICC"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
