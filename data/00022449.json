Nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications, such as in nanomedicine, nanoelectronics, biomaterials energy production, and consumer products. On the other hand, nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology, including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials, and their potential effects on global economics, as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios. These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted.","date_start":"2019-10-17","date_end":"2019-10-18","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2019-10-17","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Material/Nanotechnology","Nanotechnology"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["singapore city","Slovakia"],"name":"","street":"","city":"singapore city","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Slovakia"},"organizers":["PENCIS"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
