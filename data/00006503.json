Further, the conference considers as essential the link to Services Science, acknowledging the service-orientation in most current IT-driven collaborations. The conference is nevertheless not about the union of these two (already broad) fields, but about Cloud Computing where we are also interested in how Services Science can provide theory, methods and techniques to design, analyze, manage, market and study various aspects of Cloud Computing. CLOSER 2016 will be held in conjunction with CSEDU 2016, SMARTGREENS 2016, WEBIST 2016, VEHITS 2016 and IoTBD 2016\\.
