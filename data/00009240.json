In the process of doing so, a large amount of data with different formats and content has to be processed efficiently, quickly and intelligently through advanced algorithms, techniques, models and tools. This new paradigm is enabled by the maturity of several different technologies, including the internet, wireless communication, cloud computing, sensors, big data analytics and machine learning algorithms. IoTBDS 2017 will be held in conjunction with COMPLEXIS 2017, CLOSER 2017, SMARTGREENS 2017 and VEHITS 2017\\. Registration to IoTBDS allows free access to the COMPLEXIS, CLOSER, SMARTGREENS and VEHITS conferences (as a non-speaker).
