{"name":"\"Faces of War\" International Conference","series":"","short":"","website":"https://warstudies.lcir.co.uk","content":"War has been a constant aspect of human eras since ancient times. In fact, the idea of conflict as a means of achieving useful results has always been present in the history of evolution. Even after the end of the Second World War, when a new peaceful approach towards dispute resolution has been promoted by the most powerful nations in the world, tensions have risen again in the last few decades, particularly in some territories of the world. With the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine, Yemeni and Syrian Civil Wars (to mention just a few), it is necessary to examine the themes and approaches used in the field of War Studies and to offer a contribution towards a careful analysis of future scenarios. We invite academics from different backgrounds, including but not limited to history, philosophy, law, politics, sociology, literature, religion, economics, art, geography, anthropology, psychology, war industry, military science and cyberscience. Proposals should be related, but not limited, to: history of war; philosophy of war; legal regulation of war; war policies; sociology of war; war literature; war and cinema; war and religion; commercial wars; representation of war in the Arts; geography of war; terror wars; civil wars; war and anthropology; war and psychology; war industry; military science; cyberwars; genocides.","date_start":"2023-03-18","date_end":"2023-03-19","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2023-01-20","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Arts & Humanities","History","war studies"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Online Event","United Kingdom"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Online Event","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"United Kingdom"},"organizers":["London Centre for Interdisciplinary Research"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
