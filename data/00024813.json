{"name":"International Conference on Linear Algebra and its Applications","series":"","short":"ICLAA 2020","website":"https://carams.in/events/iclaa2020","content":"The present conference shall provide a platform for leading Mathematicians and Statisticians, working around the globe in the theme area to discuss several research issues and to introduce new innovations. The main goal of the conference is to bring experts, young researchers, and students together to present recent developments in this dynamic and important field. The conference also aims to stimulate research and support the interaction between the scientists by creating an environment for the participants to exchange ideas and to initiate collaborations and professional partnerships. The theme of the conference shall focus on Classical Matrix Theory and Linear Algebra Nonnegative Matrices and Special Matrices Matrices and Graphs Combinatorial Matrix Theory Linear Statistical Inference Matrix and Graph Methods in Statistics Matrix and Graph Methods in Biological Sciences Matrices in Error Analysis and its Applications. This conference is in a sequel to the conferences CMTGIM 2012, ICLAA 2014, and ICLAA 2017 held in Manipal during January 2012, December 2014, and December 2017 respectively. The ICLAA 2020 will be held beside 28th IWMS, and we are celebrating 100 years of C. R. Rao, who is among great Statisticians India ever produced. The common day between IWMS and ICLAA, December 17, 2020, will be celebrated as CRR Day in honor of great scholar Prof. Calyampudi Radhakrishna Rao","date_start":"2020-12-17","date_end":"2020-12-19","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2020-11-20","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Physical Science & Math","Mathematics","call for papers"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Manipal","India"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Manipal","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"India"},"organizers":["International Linear Algebra Society, CARAMS MAHE, Manipal"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
