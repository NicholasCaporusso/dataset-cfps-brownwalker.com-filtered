{"name":"2nd International Conference on Soft Computing for Security Applications ICSCS 2022","series":"","short":"","website":"http://iciotc.com/2022","content":"In recent years, soft computing is playing a prominent role in finding optimal and sustainable solutions, where it deals with uncertainty, imprecision, and approximation to leverage robust and optimal solutions into existence. Soft computing is emerging as a combinational paradigm by integrating a set of methodologies and techniques such as artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, fuzzy neural networks, expert systems, and genetic algorithms that are commonly used to build intelligent, automated and secured systems. Nevertheless, this 2nd International Conference on Soft Computing for Security Applications \\[ICSCS 2022\\] will offers a wide area by covering all domains of soft computing. The journal invites the findings and research work related to the application of soft computing techniques for security, optimization, and decision support. The main aim of ICSCS 2022 is to promote Soft Computing \\[SC\\] techniques such as fuzzy logic, neural network, support vector machines, evolutionary computation, machine learning and probabilistic reasoning to solve various real-time challenges.","date_start":"2022-04-21","date_end":"2022-04-22","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2022-04-11","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Electrical/ Electronic","Image Processing"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Salem","India"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Salem","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"India"},"organizers":["Dhirajlal Gandhi College of Technology Salem, India."],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
