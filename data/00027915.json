We believe that every healthcare decision should be informed by the best scientific research derived from rigorous, proven methodologies. In today’s world, healthcare decision makers across the globe are often faced with the need to select therapeutic “interventions” from multiple treatment options, including biopharmaceuticals, medical devices, healthcare services and digital solutions. Understanding the digital health ecosystem is the beginning of the journey to build a successful solution. We will clarify which stakeholders are involved, which kind of products we can build and how to do it, why to make great partnerships and how to identify the value proposition for a sustainable business model. In this masterclass we will work on our 6 building blocks system to develop a digital health product. We will see the latest movements in the market, and the main diseases where digital products start to offer real success. We will clearly transit to a different way of working, in a more agile way. We will identify the risks and opportunities in the different phases of development, from the discovery phase to the development phase passing by clinical, regulatory, and go to market.","date_start":"2021-09-23","date_end":"2021-09-24","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Medicine & Health","Public-Health"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Online Event","Hungary"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Online Event","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Hungary"},"organizers":["GLC Europe"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
