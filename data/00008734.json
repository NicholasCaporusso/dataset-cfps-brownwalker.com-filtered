{"name":"Forum on specification & Design Languages","series":"","short":"","website":"www.ecsi.org/fdl","content":"Forum on specification & Design Languages (FDL) is a well established international forum devoted to dissemination of research results, practical experiences and new ideas in the application of specification, design and verification languages to the design, modelling and verification of integrated circuits, complex hardware/software embedded systems, and mixed-technology systems. Modelling and specification concepts push the development of new design and verification methodologies to ESL (Electronic System Level) thus providing a means for model-driven and automated design of complex electronic systems in a variety of application domains. FDL gives an opportunity to gain up-to-date knowledge in many broad areas of the fast evolving field of system design and verification. Through collaboration with the Accellera Systems Initiative FDL maintains a strong link to many EDA standards like SystemC, OCP and IP-XACT.","date_start":"2016-09-14","date_end":"2016-09-16","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2016-04-25","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Electrical/ Electronic"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Bremen","Germany"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Bremen","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Germany"},"organizers":["IEEE"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
