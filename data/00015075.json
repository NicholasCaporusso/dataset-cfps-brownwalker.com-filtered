Digital transformation is the profound transformation of business and organizational activities, processes, competencies and models to fully leverage the changes and opportunities of a mix of digital technologies and their accelerating impact across society in a strategic and prioritized way, with present and future. Source: https://www.i-scoop.eu/digital-transformation/ The economic models of the digital era are more disruptive than evolutionary, and are very different to those practiced by traditional enterprises. This implies that digital transformation is not the sum of a few client-oriented projects but something that touches every aspect of the business. It requires rethinking the activities of the business across five axes: 1\\. Customer experience, adapted to the unique needs of each client. 2\\. Business model, operating across channels and the whole ecosystem. 3\\. Operational effectiveness, with data-centric processes and a focus on results. 4\\. Digital-native organizations can change their modus operandi in flight, in order to improve performance and deliver better customer service. 5\\. The Challenge for traditional organisations is to deliver comparable flexibility. Change the culture by bringing in new blood! The ultimate key to digital transformation is changing the spirit of the business so that everyone thinks ‘digital first’. This is only possible if the management impetus is strong: in years to come, digital should become a board-level topic reaching across the organization. At its current maturity, however, recruitment of a Chief Digital Officer, reporting to the board, enables digital to encompass the organization chart and drive transformation forward. In a nutshell, digital transformation has enabled the process of digitalization and created unique market place for businessmen. One has to unleash the potential of digitalization and reap the benefits to succeed in their domain of operations. Research indicates that digitalization has a lot of upside potential.
