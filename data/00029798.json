The congress will move forward with the theme “Exploring the Grey Areas of Neurological Research.” The global summit analyses current developments in the field of neurology research as well as other neurological topics including brain disorders, and it promises to be the best platform for anybody interested in learning about the latest trends in neuroscience research and development. We are working hard to ensure that this year's hybrid summit meets the highest quality standards, based on feedback from our previous neurological conferences. All participants can share their points of view/presentations throughout the two-day scientific gathering, they can ask questions on the presentation without reluctance. The major goal is to bring together more people from many strands of important neuroscience disciplines to make this meeting transdisciplinary. Let's make this year's INBC 2022 the best yet by focusing on the unforgettable moments, friendships and camaraderie, knowledge exchange, and prospects for achievement that we create when we're all together.
