Accordingly, computing systems are growing in capability and complexity including hardware, software, communications, networks, platforms, services, etc. Advanced computing (AC) aims to discover, develop, and deploy computational and networking capabilities, and to design and develop novel computing systems and architectures. At the same time, computing must be trustworthy to engender confidence that systems will remain secure and available. Trust/distrust relationships in the Internet, Web applications and pervasive infrastructures are key factors to enable dynamic interaction and cooperation of various users, systems, and services. Trusted computing (TC) aims at making computing and communication systems and services available, predictable, accountable, controllable, assessable, sustainable, dependable, persistent, and secure. ATC conferences have taken a leading role in addressing these challenges and achieving practical advanced computing systems with truly trustworthy services. Started in 2005, the series of ATC conferences have been held at Nagasaki (Japan), Vienna (Austria), Three Gorges (China), Hong Kong (China), Oslo (Norway), Brisbane (Australia), Xi'An (China), Banff (Canada), Fukuoka (Japan), Vietri sul Mare (Italy), Bali (Indonesia) and Beijing (China). ATC 2016 will include a highly selective program of technical papers, accompanied by workshops, panel discussions, and keynote speeches. Established as a premier venue in the area of advanced and trusted computing, ATC 2016 will offer a forum for researchers to exchange ideas and experiences in the most innovative research and development in these challenging areas and include all technical aspects related to Advanced Computing (AC) and Trusted Computing (TC). The ATC 2016 topics include, but are not limited to: Track 1: Software Defined Networking Security and Trust Track 2: Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain based Systems Track 3: Privacy Preservation in Big Data Track 4: Middleware for IoT Track 5: Service Engineering for IoT Track 6: Trust, Security and Privacy in Social Networks Track 7: Trust Models Management and Standards Track 8: Trustworthy authentication in Pervasive Computing Track 9: Privacy and trust management in distributed systems Workshops ---------- The ATC 2016 Organizing Committee invites proposals for workshops associated with the conference, addressing research areas related to the conference. Accepted workshop papers will be included in the proceedings published by IEEE CS Press. Click the following links for submission details/deadlines. For workshop proposals, please refer to: http://atc2016.sciencesconf.org/ Paper submission ----------------- Main conference papers are limited to 8 pages (full papers), or 4 pages (short papers), following the IEEE CS format, and are to be submitted as PDF via the ATC 2016 submission site: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=atc2016 Paper publication ----------------- Accepted conference papers will be published by IEEE CPS (IEEE-DL and EI indexed). At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register and present their work at the conference; otherwise the paper will not be included in the proceedings. Best Paper Awards will be presented to high quality papers. Selected papers, after further extensions and revisions, will be published in special issues of prestigious journals.
