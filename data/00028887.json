Nanotechnology and Material science are rapidly expanding by playing a prominent role in many fields. This Conference is a platform to Industry, Academia, Researchers, Innovators to come together to discuss the research activities, advancements, ideas and exhibit Nano products. Nanotechnology is rapidly gaining traction across a range of industries, from agriculture to water treatment to energy storage. Today, nanotechnology is one of the most innovative, cutting-edge areas of scientific study and it continues to advance at staggering rates. Nanoparticles for chemotherapy drug carriers have made some of the greatest advancements in cancer treatment. By using nanocarriers to treat patients, treatments can focus on targeting cancerous cells and limit the damage to healthy cells. scientists in the nanotechnoloy and nanoagriculture fields are focused on determining how nanosized particles can increase crop and livestock productivity. While nanoagriculture is a more recent application of nanotechnology, the benefits are clear with its “potential to protect plants, monitor plant growth, detect plant and animal diseases, increase global food production, enhance food quality and reduce waste.” Scientists and engineers are focused on","date_start":"2022-03-28","date_end":"2022-03-30","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Physical Science & Math","Chemistry","Nanotechnology"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["san francisco","France"],"name":"","street":"","city":"san francisco","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"France"},"organizers":["LINKIN SCIENC E"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
