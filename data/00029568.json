{"name":"Global Conference on Biofuels and Bioenergy","series":"","short":"","website":"https://biofuels-energy.magnusconferences.com","content":"Magnus Group is delighted to invite you to its upcoming “Global Conference on Biofuels and Bioenergy” (Biofuels 2022), which will take place in Orlando, Florida, USA in Hybrid Format from October 21 -22, 2022\\. The congress's major theme is “Biofuels and Bioenergy: New Era Technologies Striving for Sustainability,” and it will feature unique and essential breakthroughs in the disciplines of Biofuels and Bioenergy. ‘Net Zero Emissions by 2050' recognises bioenergy as a viable option, with bioenergy accounting for 18 percent of total energy supply in 2050 and playing a key role in achieving carbon neutrality in the global energy system, either directly by replacing fossil fuels or indirectly by combining bioenergy with carbon capture, storage, and utilisation. Biomass/biofuels would need to play a bigger part in industry, transportation, and heat and power generation. The global congress will concentrate on the most recent advancements and opportunities in biomass/bioenergy in various sectors, as well as sustainable feedstock mobilisation and biomass's role in a circular bio-economy. The scientific sessions span key topics in the field of biofuels and bioenergy including Biorefineries, First, Second and Third Generation Biofuels, Biodiesel & Green Diesel, Bioalcohols, Bioethanol, Biobutanol, Biochar, Bioproducts, Biogas, Biomethane & Biohydrogen, Bio-Oil, Bioprocesses and many more.
