{"name":"Alterity Revisited - A Closer Look at Transpositions of a Traveling Concept in the Humanities","series":"","short":"","website":"https://bit.ly/2JQvgRZ","content":"The present extended workshop has the aim of tracing and mapping the transpositions of the concept of alterity in an interdisciplinary context shaped by an almost uncontrollable methodological and theoretical eclecticism. The two invited professors, Christine Abbt (University of Lucerne) and Thomas Claviez (University of Bern), will frame the discussions of seminal texts theorizing alterity that will take place in two text sessions – Text Session I: Democracy and Alterity (led by C. Abbt); Text Session II: Alterity, Contingency, and the Difference of it All (led by T. Claviez). For further details, visit workshop announcement on www.unilu.ch/gsl (--> Veranstaltungen/Events). The target group for attending the workshop is (post-)doctoral students from all disciplines within the Humanities (and Social Sciences) who are either directly working on alterity in their own research or have a keen interest in the concept. The call is now open (see official website URL above). Please apply by sending a short CV and statement of motivation (300-500 words) to gsl@unilu.ch by August 15th, 2018.","date_start":"2018-12-07","date_end":"2018-12-08","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2018-08-15","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Arts & Humanities","Philosophy"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Lucerne","Switzerland"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Lucerne","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Switzerland"},"organizers":["Graduate School of Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Lucerne – in the framework of"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":["gsl@unilu.ch"]}
