{"name":"Twelfth Conference on the Intersections of Particle and Nuclear Physics","series":"","short":"","website":"http://cipanp2015.yale.edu","content":"CIPANP is a conference designed to explore areas of interest to scientists working in elementary particle physics, nuclear physics, astrophysics, particle astrophysics, nuclear astrophysics, and cosmology. Topics include theory, experiment, and instrumentation, as well as facilities needed for the study of fundamental interactions, elementary particles, nucleons and nuclei, astrophysical phenomena, and cosmic rays. CIPANP 2015 encourages participation by scientists of diverse backgrounds and facilitates the participation of younger scientists. It is intended to publish the CIPANP 2015 Proceedings, as was done previously, through the American Institute of Physics.","date_start":"2015-05-19","date_end":"2015-05-24","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Physical Science & Math","Astronomy/Astrophysics","nuclear physics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Vail","United States"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Vail","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"United States"},"organizers":[""],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
