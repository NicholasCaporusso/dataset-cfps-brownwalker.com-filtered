{"name":"Second International Conference on Molecular Diagnostics and Biomarker Discovery","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.mdbd.usm.my","content":"Diagnostics is a broad area that covers biomarker discoveries, enabling technologies and development and evaluation of assays based on nucleic acids, proteins/peptides and small molecules. In the era of evidence-based medicine, good diagnostics are crucial; hence there is a need for the continuous introduction of innovative technologies and solutions. Themed as ‘Advances in Biomarker Discovery and Technologies for Better Diagnostics’, this conference aims to gather scientists and partners to present and deliberate on their latest findings related to the diagnosis of infectious and non-infectious diseases. We have a good line-up of invited speakers which include scientists from academic and research institutions, as well from the industry. With your active participation, we hope this conference will be scientifically invigorating, while fostering new friendships and collaborations.","date_start":"2017-05-02","date_end":"2017-05-04","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2017-03-03","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Medicine & Health","Medical-Speciality"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Penang","Malaysia"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Penang","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Malaysia"},"organizers":[""],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
