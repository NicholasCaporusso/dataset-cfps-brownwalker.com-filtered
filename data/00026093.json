Many companies are interested in hosting a lean operation in order to maximize productivity and operate with minimal resources, but enough to be as effective as possible. Six Sigma refers to ensuring the expectations of customers, consumers, or users are met within a tolerable variance. The focus is on quality and consistency, ensuring results always deliver to meet or exceed customer expectation. These principles together are critical to creating a sustainable company, building a reputable brand, and ensuring a maximum productivity operation at the company. Lean Six Sigma involves thorough process identification and documentation and considering all factors when making decisions that will impact the business.
