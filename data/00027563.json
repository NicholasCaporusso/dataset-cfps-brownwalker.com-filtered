{"name":"International Conference on Trends in Smart Material Engineering and Technology","series":"","short":"ICSMT 2021","website":"http://www.ictsmet.com","content":"The recent innovations in smart materials and material engineering attempts to mimic the adaptive and sustainable characteristics accompanied with intelligent physical properties and active as well as passive control.in many technical systems and applications. Moreover, smart materials will also have some unique properties to couple the mechanical and non-mechanical properties and they also have major groups like magnetostrictive materials, shape memory alloys, piezoelectric, shape memory alloys, electro-magneto systems. Nowadays, smart material technologies are leveraging remarkable properties in emerging fields like robotics, bio-engineering, aerospace, mechanical system control, and so on. In order to consolidate and discuss the state-of-the-art research innovations in this emerging smart materials paradigm, the International Conference on trends in Smart Material Engineering and Technology 2021 \\[ICSMT 2021\\] has been planned. Nevertheless, ICSMT 2021 primarily aims on presenting the general overview, research contribution, and the recent research innovations in material science engineering, smart materials and its applications.","date_start":"2021-10-21","date_end":"2021-10-22","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2021-10-08","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Material/Nanotechnology","Smart Materials"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Salem","Tamilnadu","India"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Salem","state":"Tamilnadu","ZIP":"","country":"India"},"organizers":["Narasu's Sarathy Institute of Technology"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
