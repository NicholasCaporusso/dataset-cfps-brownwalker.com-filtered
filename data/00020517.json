The brain itself creates an immune privilege to protect its own tissue from the damage caused as an effect of eliminating the threat. The protection of sensitive tissue of brain is done by microglia(sentinels) without perturbing its nerve-cell connections and pathways. The dis-regulation of immune system and nervous system results in lifelong disorders which are classified under neuro immune disorders.

The medicines could develop side effects depending on patients medical condition. Some could develop medical dependence(addiction) as well as withdrawal(sudden stop) symptoms if they are contentiously using the medicine. The patient could take over dosage of medicines in certain neural condition to achieve certain effects which could lead him/her to depression.

This situation can be literally described as emotional disturbance due to disturbed brain malfunction. This could lead to mental disorders and at times memory loss which could be a symptom of dementia , Alzheimer's disease etc…A degenerative type of disorder which affects the motor. system and thereby affecting muscle rigidity, speech and gait of an individual is termed as Parkinson’s disease.

How they are processed? And the answer lies in the complex functioning of brain. Yes the study which deals with the structure and functioning of brain is mentioned above. Neuro psychology seeks to discover how the brain correlates with the mind which could result in change of emotion, behaviour of an individual. Neuro-psychological tests are specially done to discover the psychological functions of certain parts of brain. It can be also used to measure the intelligence and memory. Neuropsychological tests plays an important role in the process of conducting neuropsychological assessment, along with personal, interpersonal and contextual factors. Cognitive neuropsychology relates the functioning of brain to the various psychological process and are responsible for our cognitive abilities.

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder(ADHD) and epilepsy can have adverse effects on a child's behaviour and social development. Children with epilepsy and ADHD are likely to be at higher risk for more negative outcomes in school and in terms of quality of life compared with children with epilepsy alone . Autism spectrum disorders correlates group of developmental disorders such as symptoms, levels of disability and other social problems.

When this process of communication is damaged or disrupted the condition is referred to as neuropathy. Multiple damage of peripheral nerves is known as poly neuropathy while mono neuropathy describes the damage of a single nerve. Aging , consumption of alcohol , usage of certain drugs, cancers, tumors could lead to this situation, some may inherit it through genes. It could also lead to several complications on human health such as loss of sensation , numbness , muscle atrophy.

A neurosurgeon does this with his utmost care and skills any defect happened cannot be replaced. Many methods of surgery are present and they chooses the perfect method. Micro surgery is the most adopted process of surgery where a neurosurgeon uses a microscope for the surgical process. Radio surgical methods describes the process of precise application of focused radiation on the target area predetermined by imaging techniques. Neuro anaesthesia is mainly administrated for patients who are undergoing neurosurgery, hence it will be having adverse effects on brain and spinal cord continuous monitoring is preferred during the entire process. Any type of injury to the spine can be described as spinal cord trauma which could deadly dangerous. Brain haemorrhage relates to stroke where the artery bursts and kills the cells in the brain which also cause localized bleeding. Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery(DBS) is mainly performed for patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease, two electrodes are placed inside the brain as the patient remains awake during the surgery. A neurostimulator deliver electrical impulses to the electrodes to decrease the symptoms of the disease.

The medical care is provided with proper care without any mistakes from the care team which includes nurses , neurologists , neurosurgeons etc…Continuous monitoring is done by most advanced monitoring systems and basic life supporting equipments. Secondary brain injuries require more concern as changes may evolve suddenly over hours or to days. Coma patients can recover from their existing state with some sudden response and require special care at times . Neuro emergencies include sudden stroke , brain injury , spine injury which have to be treated immediately.

These waveforms differs for various activities such as sleeping, pain, stress etc….. sleep disorders are mainly diagnosed by this method . Encephalitis is a disorder which causes an inflammation in brain which could also result in memory problems and can be found out by EEG patterns.

The deeper part of examination is done by various types of imaging process as well as radiological process. As the cerebral blood flow and neuronal activation are coupled Functional magnetic resonance imaging technique can be used to detect brain activities . In case of brain injuries computed axial tomography can be used to detect the abnormalities . Cranial ultrasound can be used for babies to detect the problems regarding brain and premature birth and for adults it can be performed when the skull is opened for surgery as ultrasound cannot pass through bones. Positron emission tomography can detect early stages of alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. The neuromagnetic signals generated by the brain are extremely small which can be detected by the SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) device and can amplify magnetic fields generated by neurons a few centimetres away from the sensors . MEG provides timing as well as spatial information about brain activity.

The system includes biological neural connection networks which are inspired from actual nervous system. Neurorobotics is that branch of neuroscience with robotics, which deals with the study and application of science and technology of embodied autonomous neural systems like brain-inspired algorithms. locomotion and motor control mechanisms are inspired directly from action of human motor system while memory revolves around the patterns. Biological robots are specially designed to replace the amputated organs which could perform the same function as the original organ. Human-robot interface is basically the interaction between human and robot which includes artificial intelligence, language understanding.

Investigations and research are continuously been done in the field of neuroscience. Among them neurosurgery adopts most the advanced techniques for surgical process. Surgeries done under local anaesthesia for brain tumors such as awake craniotomy enables the surgeon to perform the surgery more accurately. The objective of precision medicine is to deliver right treatment to right person at right time which decreases the effects neuro disorders.
