{"name":"2nd Scopus-Indexed IEEE International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications [ICIRCA 2020]","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.icirca18.com/2020","content":"In recent years, Computing emerges as an integral part of almost all the modern industries like Software Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Information technology. It is evident from the recent computing applications that it can easily encompass the design and development of various hardware and software architectures to be capable of structuring, managing and processing a different kind of information available in the emerging intelligent system architectures. With its ability to transform information, there exists a various number of smart computing applications like cloud computing, edge computing, ubiquitous computing, quantum computing, and social computing. Despite the hype, some areas of computing still need some research exploration. In this regard, the International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications \\[ICIRCA 2020\\] organized by RVS College of Engineering and Technology, Coimbatore, India on 15-17, July 2020 has been devoted to facilitate synergy of state-of-the-art research works that address the different facets of computing applications. ICIRCA 2020 provides a communication platform for researchers, academicians, and industrialists in computing from all around the world.","date_start":"2020-07-15","date_end":"2020-07-17","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2020-06-25","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Electrical/ Electronic"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["coimbatore","India"],"name":"","street":"","city":"coimbatore","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"India"},"organizers":["RVS College of Engineering and Technology"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
