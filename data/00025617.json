R&D needs flexibility and should not be over-regulated, whereas GMP concentrates on standardization and high throughput. On the other hand, R&D has to create a solid and robust fundament to enable manufacturing and quality control to work according to established and efficient procedures. The training aims to generate a common understanding of how to best interlink these two areas and create highly efficient processes from product development to routine manufacturing of generic pharmaceutical products.","date_start":"2020-07-28","date_end":"2020-07-29","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2020-07-27","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Medicine & Health","Pharmaceutical / Medicinal","Pharmacology & Pharmaceuticals"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Online Event","Hungary"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Online Event","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Hungary"},"organizers":["GLC Europe"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
