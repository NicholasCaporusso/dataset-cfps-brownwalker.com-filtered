{"name":"10th International Conference on Sustainable Water Resources Management","series":"","short":"","website":"https://www.wessex.ac.uk/conferences/2019/water-resources-management-2019","content":"The tenth International Conference on Sustainable Water Resources Management will present recent technological and scientific developments, associated with the management of surface and sub-surface water resources. Water is essential for sustaining life on our planet and its uneven distribution is a source of permanent conflict. The growth of human population combined with the irregularity in precipitation and water availability may restrict even further the access to water in certain regions of the world. This problem is made more severe by anthropogenic activities that affect its quality. The Conference provides a platform for professionals involved in water resources management to exchange knowledge and gain an insight into the state of the art in the current technology, techniques and solutions in sustainable water management as they have been developed and applied in different countries. Participants include a wide variety of stakeholders from research and academia, to industrial sectors as well as government organisations.","date_start":"2019-05-07","date_end":"2019-05-09","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2019-02-01","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Business","Human-Resources","environmental engineering"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Alicante","Spain"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Alicante","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Spain"},"organizers":["WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
