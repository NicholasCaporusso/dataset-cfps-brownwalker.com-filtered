{"name":"GSTF LRPP - 6th Annual International Conference on Law, Regulations and Public Policy","series":"","short":"","website":"http://law-conference.org","content":"The laws of the land lay the foundations of peace and order, and to ensure people progress in all aspects of their lives â€“ whether in business, education, travel, health or recreation. The role of public officials is to create, scrutinize, implement and uphold the laws in order to protect the rights of every individual, corporate entity or institution. Educators of law thus possess the task of not only shaping each and every generation of legal practitioners into knowledgeable and responsible agents, but also the study of issues which surround the practice of law and its implementation across jurisdictions.","date_start":"2017-06-05","date_end":"2017-06-06","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2017-03-31","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Education / Legal / Other","Law/Legal-Studies","Public policy and administration"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Singapore","Singapore"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Singapore","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Singapore"},"organizers":["Global Science and Technology Forum"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
