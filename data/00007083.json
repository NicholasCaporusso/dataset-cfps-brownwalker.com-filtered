{"name":"The 6th International Conference on Simulation and Modeling Methodologies, Technologies and Applications- SIMULTECH 2016","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.simultech.org","content":"Scope: The purpose of the 6th International Conference on Simulation and Modeling Methodologies, Technologies and Applications (SIMULTECH) is to bring together researchers, engineers, applied mathematicians and practitioners interested in the advances and applications in the field of system simulation. Four simultaneous tracks will be held, covering on one side domain independent methodologies and technologies and on the other side practical work developed in specific application areas. The specific topics listed under each of these tracks highlight the interest of this conference in aspects related to computing, including Conceptual Modeling, Agent Based Modeling and Simulation, Interoperability, Ontologies, Knowledge Based Decision Support, Petri Nets, Business Process Modeling and Simulation, amongst others. SIMULTECH 2016 will be held in conjunction with ICINCO 2016\\. CONFERENCE AREAS: Each of these topic areas is expanded below but the sub-topics list is not exhaustive. Papers may address one or more of the listed sub-topics, although authors should not feel limited by them. Unlisted but related sub-topics are also acceptable, provided they fit in one of the following main topic areas: 1\\. SIMULATION TOOLS AND PLATFORMS 2\\. FORMAL METHODS 3\\.
