{"name":"Quantum Technology International Conference","series":"","short":"","website":"http://premc.org/conferences/qtech-quantum-technology","content":"The growing ability to manipulate quantum systems is paving the way for a second quantum revolution and a number of initiatives worldwide have been formed to foster quantum technologies. These exciting novel applications are exploiting specific quantum properties which are not accessible with classical resources such as superposition and entanglement of individual quantum systems. The objectives of the QTech conference is to present the latest developments of quantum technologies in the domains of quantum communication, computation, simulation, sensors and metrology, and their implementation using various platforms from atoms and ions to solid states, superconducting circuits and optics. ---- Topics: Quantum information processing and computing, Quantum simulation, Quantum sensors and quantum metrology, Quantum communication, Fundamental science for quantum technologies, Atom and ion trapping, Superconducting circuits, Quantum optics and non-classical light sources, Solid states and hybrid systems. ---- Website: http://premc.org/conferences/qtech-quantum-technology/ // Twitter: @QTech\\_Quantum ‚Äè// e-Mail: qtech2018@premc.org // Tel.: +331.46.60.89.40","date_start":"2018-09-05","date_end":"2018-09-07","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2018-06-20","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Physical Science & Math","Physics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Paris","France"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Paris","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"France"},"organizers":[""],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":["qtech2018@premc.org"]}
