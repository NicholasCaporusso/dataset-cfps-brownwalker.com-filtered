The aim of the Kaleidoscope conferences is to identify emerging developments in information and communication technologies (ICTs) and, in particular, areas in need of international standards to aid the healthy development of the Information Society. Kaleidoscope 2018 calls for original scientific papers addressing advances in research on machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques for future communication networks, covering all aspects of network design, management, implementation and optimization. This yearâ€™s conference will assist ITU standardization experts in capitalizing on machine learning in their preparations for the 5G era and beyond. Authors of outstanding papers will be invited to contribute to the work of ITU-T Focus Group on Machine Learning for Future Networks including 5G.","date_start":"2018-11-26","date_end":"2018-11-28","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2018-06-25","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics","Fuzzy Logic, Math & Computing"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Santa Fe","Argentina"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Santa Fe","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Argentina"},"organizers":["International Telecommunication Union (ITU), technically co-sponsored by IEEE & IEEE ComSoc"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
