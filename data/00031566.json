{"name":"6th International Conference on Future of Social Sciences","series":"","short":"","website":"https://www.icfss.org","content":"Over the last few decades, there has been significant progress and developments in the field of social sciences, both in terms of frameworks and the application of technologies. A great deal of work was put into recording and presenting all this information in the past. However, these need to be updated with better techniques, and educational tools — that’s where ICFSS 2023 comes in. Learn and incorporate these new and improved methods of research and education at this great conference. Being one of the most prestigious social science conferences in the world, we have experienced an internationally diverse audience pool in the past and expect even higher attendance and diversity this year. Learn about a range of interesting topics — the effectiveness of early warning by international organizations, the antecedents, and consequences of posters’ regret on social network sites, and the future of theories of perception and representation — that have been conscientiously selected by our wonderful scientific committee.","date_start":"2023-09-15","date_end":"2023-09-17","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2023-08-25","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Arts & Humanities","Philosophy","Sociology, Social Sciences"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Prague","Czech Republic"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Prague","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Czech Republic"},"organizers":["Acavent"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
