Now it is time to globally reconsider the meaning of \"healthy aging\". We invite researchers in various sectors around the world and discuss what is \"healthy aging\" and what we can do now for our own later life. We will invite Dr. Douglas K. Sato from Brazil who is neurologist specialized in gerontology, Dr. Daniel Holman from England who specializes in social sciences especially with respect to health inequalities and aging, and Dr. Yasumichi Arai from Japan who has been studying extensively on health of centenarians and its influencing factors from various perspectives. With Dr. Jin Nakahara, neurologist and the project leader of the Extending Healthy Life Expectancy Project, they will discuss the future of healthy aging and healthy life expectancy.","date_start":"2022-02-28","date_end":"","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Medicine & Health","Public-Health"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Online Event","Japan"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Online Event","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Japan"},"organizers":["Keio University Global Research Institute"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
