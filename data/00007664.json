{"name":"Pacific Conference on Pre-K through K-12 Education","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.thinksisu.org/education","content":"Educating youngsters is always a challenge, all the more so in racially and culturally diverse classrooms with many non-native language learners and foster youth students, and few benefiting from early childhood programs. These issues are more pronounced in California than most other states, but recent State legislation aims to shift decisions on priorities and fund allocations to the local level. This conference encourages research and informed discussion of these issues.","date_start":"2016-06-03","date_end":"2016-06-05","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2016-05-01","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Education / Legal / Other","Education","educational leadership"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Palm Springs","California","United States"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Palm Springs","state":"California","ZIP":"","country":"United States"},"organizers":["The Sisu Advantage"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
