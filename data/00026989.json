{"name":"6th Annual International Gender and Sexuality Studies Conference","series":"","short":"","website":"https://www.uco.edu/academic-affairs/thecenter/conference","content":"IGSS Call for Abstracts The International Gender and Sexuality Studies Conference is presented by the Women’s Research Center and the BGLTQ+ Student Center at the University of Central Oklahoma with assistance from the UCO chapter of the National Organization for Women. In tandem, these organizations promote intellectual engagement with Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality issues. For 2021, our conference theme is “Inclusive, Intersectional, Interdisciplinary.” How do diverse people inhabit the juncture of Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality studies? How can academics and activists work together to advance deep thinking and real-world change? How do our different backgrounds – in terms of lived experiences, scholarly fields, and political goals – help to cross-pollinate our understanding of WGSS? What productive tensions exist between these fields and experiences? How can we resolve conflict inclusively and work toward shared solutions? This year’s conference will gather together voices from across the complex ecosystem of gender and sexuality studies, creating a crossroads for conversation. While all submissions are welcome, the selection committee encourages presentations that fit in line with this year’s theme. This intersectional conference welcomes proposals that address issues of gender and sexuality across various disciplines, including, but not limited to, the social sciences, humanities, fine arts, activism, and STEM fields. We invite students, faculty, staff, scholars, and activists to propose papers, panels, roundtable discussions, and poster presentations. We also welcome proposals to present or perform creative work, including creative writing, drama, music, and visual art.
