The authors will introduce the studies combined with four fields crucial for older people, their families, and communities: combatting ageism, age-friendly environments, integrated care, and long-term care. The volume also intends to cover issues linked to the global, national, regional, and local implementation of age-specific and intergenerational solutions, initiatives, and programs towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The collection will contain papers representing research and practical recommendations from various disciplines such as demography, critical studies, the economics of ageing, educational gerontology, geropsychology, gerontechnology, geographical gerontology, longevity studies, public health, social work, and sociology. This volume will be an asset to academic and professional communities interested in theories of ageing as well as public services and ageing policies. In addition, the book aims to help students, practitioners, and people working in government, business, and nonprofit organizations.
