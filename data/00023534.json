{"name":"5th International Conference on Complexity, Future Information Systems and Risk - COMPLEXIS 2020","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.complexis.org","content":"COMPLEXIS – The International Conference on Complexity, Future Information Systems and Risk, aims at becoming a yearly meeting place for presenting and discussing innovative views on all aspects of Complex Information Systems, in different areas such as Informatics, Telecommunications, Computational Intelligence, Biology, Biomedical Engineering and Social Sciences. Information is pervasive in many areas of human activity – perhaps all – and complexity is a characteristic of current Exabyte-sized, highly connected and hyper dimensional, information systems. COMPLEXIS 2020 is expected to provide an overview of the state of the art as well as upcoming trends, and to promote discussion about the potential of new methodologies, technologies and application areas of complex information systems, in the academic and corporate world. \n COMPLEXIS 2020 seeks papers reporting research work, applications or case-studies, on topics indicated below in the section “Conference Areas”. Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques and general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Both technological and social-oriented papers are accepted. All papers must describe original work, not previously published or submitted to another conference. Accepted papers, presented at the conference by one of the authors, will be published in the Proceedings of COMPLEXIS under an ISBN, and will be indexed by major indexes. Acceptance will be based on quality, relevance and originality. Both full research reports (regular papers) and work-in-progress reports (position papers) are welcome. There will be both oral and poster sessions. \n Special sessions, dedicated to case-studies and focused presentations, as well as tutorials dedicated to technical/scientific topics are also envisaged: companies interested in presenting their products/methodologies or researchers interested in holding a tutorial, workshop or special session are invited to contact the conference secretariat or visit the conference website. \n Conference Topics: \n Area 1: Complexity in Informatics and Networking \n \\- Chaos Theory and Applications \n \\- Complex Networks \n \\- Complexity Theory \n \\- Connected Vehicles \n \\- Internet and the Semantic Web \n \\- Simulation and Modeling \n \\- Usability of Complex Information Systems \n \\- Community Structure in Networks \n \\- Deep Learning \n \\- Self-Organizing Systems and Intelligent Systems \n Area 2: Complexity in Biology and Biomedical Engineering \n \\- Artificial Life \n \\- Bioinformatics \n \\- Biological and Biomedical Data Mining \n \\- Biomedical Imaging and Data Visualization \n \\- Biomedical Signal Processing \n \\- Complex Biomedical Systems and Signals \n \\- Computational Biology \n \\- Health Systems Complexity \n \\- Ontology Engineering \n \\- Population Models \n \\- Complex Networks and Epidemics \n \\- Complex Networks in Biological Systems \n Area 3: Complexity in Social Sciences \n \\- Complexity Management \n \\- Cultural Models \n \\- Data-Driven Models \n \\- Economic Complexity \n \\- Gaming \n \\- Information Systems \n \\- Linguistic and Cognitive Systems \n \\- Models of Complex Networks \n \\- Multi-Agent Systems \n \\- Security, Privacy and Trust \n \\- Social Networks \n \\- Visualization \n Area 4: Complexity in Risk and Predictive Modeling \n \\- Big Data Predictive Modeling \n \\- Error Detection, Reduction and Correction for Risk \n \\- High Performance Computing for Risk \n \\- Innovative Methods \n \\- Monte Carlo, Black Scholes, Bayesian, ARIMA, Heston and Stochastic Techniques or Analysis \n \\- Risk Analysis and Management \n \\- Behavioral Finance and Analysis \n \\- Risk Minimization, Analytics and Deep Machine Learning \n \\- Time Series Prediction \n \\- Mathematical Models \n \\- Risk Assessment \n \\- Redundancy \n Area 5: Complexity in Edge/Fog Computing \n \\- System Specification and Modeling \n \\- System Design, High-Level Synthesis and Optimization \n \\- Formal Methods and System Verification \n \\- Power Modeling, Optimization and Low-Power Design \n \\- Processor, Memory, Storage, Interconnect Designs \n \\- Reconfigurable Computing \n \\- QoS Management and Performance Analysis \n \\- New and Emerging Design Technologies \n \\- Edge/Fog Computing fundamentals \n \\- Edge/Fog Computing platforms \n \\- Edge/Fog Computing applications \n \\- Edge/Fog Computing services \n \\- Edge/Fog Computing security \n \\- Edge/Fog Computing new directions and case studies \n \\- Edge/Fog Computing challenges and recommendations \n \\- Application Areas, E.G. , Automotive, Avionics, Energy, Health Care, Mobile Devices, Multimedia and Autonomous Systems ","date_start":"2020-05-08","date_end":"2020-05-09","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2019-12-13","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Prague","Czech Republic"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Prague","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Czech Republic"},"organizers":["INSTICC"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
