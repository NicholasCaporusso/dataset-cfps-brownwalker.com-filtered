{"name":"7th Annual International Conference on Language, Literature & Linguistics â€“ L3 2018","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.l3-conference.org/ImportantDate.html","content":"Language is at a nexus of interrelationships between individuals, society and culture. The interface between language and literature has been the object of considerable interdisciplinary research on methods of analysis that can be applied across the two fields and their sub-areas. Less research has focused, however, on the influence of the new technologies on this interface, which transcends borders and cultures, with the process of translation adding yet another dimension to the already complex picture. As the technological landscape continues to evolve, ideas related through literature, other modes of artistic expression and language are part of that which is being researched through the Digital Humanities. Understanding culture, diversity and inclusion through technology adds even more unique complexity to our evolving conference themes.","date_start":"2018-06-25","date_end":"2018-06-26","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2018-02-19","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Social Sciences","Linguistics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Singapore","Singapore"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Singapore","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Singapore"},"organizers":["Global Science and Technology Forum"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
