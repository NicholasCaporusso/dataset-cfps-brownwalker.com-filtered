We also take a closer look at bias and different perspectives on autoethnography in academic writing. We explore research participants’ stories and experiences and how they appear in autoethnographic writing. We will also explore evocative aspects of writing the self, and the way that it encourages a reflexive approach thus embracing social, cultural, political and individual participants’ perspectives. The session will use a mixture of group discussion, Q&A, and critiques and will be facilitated by Dr R. de Matas – educator (FHEA), editor in chief at the Interdisciplinary Discourses, Education and Analysis journal (IDEA), and editor and founder of Festival Culture, Research and Education (FCRE). All the registered participants who will attend the workshop will receive certificates. In order to book a place, please register on http://registration.lcir.co.uk by 15 September 2020\\.
