{"name":"Modern Synthetic Organic Reactions","series":"","short":"","website":"https://go.evvnt.com/577183-3?pid=4868","content":"Driven by the increasing complexity of synthetic targets and the need for efficient, selective and environmentally benign synthetic methods, the past decade has seen tremendous innovation and reaction understanding in the field of synthetic organic chemistry. However, much like the transition of a molecule from discovery to development, the transition and application of new synthetic methodology from a research setting to an industrially relevant context can be challenging. This course is designed to look in detail at essential new synthetic chemistry methodology and its potential application in addressing key challenges in industry. New processes will be presented with case studies and examples. In addition, an understanding of what it takes to transfer technology from an academic to a larger scale industrial context will be discussed.
