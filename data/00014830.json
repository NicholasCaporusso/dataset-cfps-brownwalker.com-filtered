This workshop was selected as a best practice in agile management at the Agile Business Day held in Venice last September, at Rochester University - Dubai Silicon Oasis - World Quality Day, and at the European Code Week in Barcelona. In this workshop, we learn the fundamental aspects that condition the volatile, uncertain, changing and ambiguous environment (in English, VUCA World) that governs the society of the 21st century, with a special emphasis in the way the agility and adaptability of People and work teams are key to managing daily tasks. The latest version of the EFQM Model of Excellence defines agile management and innovation as fundamental values and excellence in organizations. In this workshop, we show, through the gamification and with the metaphorical support of TerryGilliam’s film (ex-Monty Phyton) Zero Theorem, the strong relationship between agility and innovation, and how the concept of adaptability is closely linked. The working language of this workshop is English. This event is free of charge for the conference participants of the 4th Annual International Conference on Communication and Management (ICCM2018) but pre-registration is required.
