{"name":"13th International Conference on Advances in Fluid Mechanics","series":"","short":"","website":"https://www.wessex.ac.uk/conferences/2020/afm-2020","content":"\\*Status Update\\* Please note that following the recent events on the Coronavirus pandemic and with the main objective to preserve the well being of our delegates, WIT has decided to postpone the AFM 2020 conference until after the summer break. The conference was due to be held 2-4 June 2020 in Prague, Czech Republic and will now be held 1-3 September 2020 in Prague, Czech Republic. \\*\\*\\* The field of fluid mechanics is vast and has numerous and diverse applications. The conference covers a wide range of topics, including basic formulations and their computer modelling as well as the relationship between experimental and analytical results. The emphasis is on new applications and research currently in progress. The papers – like others presented at Wessex Institute conferences – are part of the WIT Transactions in Engineering Sciences series and are archived online in the WIT eLibrary (www.witpress.com/elibrary), where they are freely available to the international scientific community.","date_start":"2020-09-01","date_end":"2020-09-03","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2020-05-01","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Mechanical/Industrial","mechanical engineering"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Prague","Czech Republic"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Prague","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Czech Republic"},"organizers":["Wessex Institute"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
