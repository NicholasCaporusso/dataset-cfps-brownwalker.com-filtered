For the past six years, Conference Series has organised the premier international conference for professionals in the field of neurology. The congress will be proudly co-hosted by the Conference Series with over 1000 neurologist members. We anticipate that this occasion will return us to our regular congress schedule, allowing us to meet up in person to renew old bonds of friendship and collaborate on fresh projects. This Conference will bring us up to date in the broad field of Child neurology, from tropical neurology to mental Health. The Scientific Program and Teaching Programs are at the core of the Pediatric Neurology. The Tournament of the Minds, cutting edge scientific sessions pertinent to every region of the world, plenary lectures from top authorities in their disciplines, cutting edge scientific poster sessions, and plenary lectures by up-and-coming neurologists round out the program. The Pediatric Neurology 2023 provides a fantastic platform for communication and interaction in addition to education and science. We will be able to observe and gain knowledge from one another after more than two years of pandemic limitations! Dublin is a fantastic destination, bustling metropolis that is safe and reasonably priced. This biennial meeting offers the Pediatric Neurology 2023 and its Member Societies a chance to emphasise the universal nature of our neurological environment. We sincerely hope you can join us for this outstanding meeting!","date_start":"2023-06-12","date_end":"2023-06-13","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2023-05-25","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience","neurology & neuroscience"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Dublin","Ireland","Ireland"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Dublin","state":"Ireland","ZIP":"","country":"Ireland"},"organizers":["https://www.conferenceseries.com/about.php"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
