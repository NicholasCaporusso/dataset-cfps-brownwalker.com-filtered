{"name":"Establishing the Predominant Position of ESP within Adult ELT - 3rd International ESP Conference and Summer School http://esp.elfak.rs","series":"","short":"","website":"http://esp.elfak.rs","content":"This event is to establish a new scholarly gathering format, giving significant amount of time to participants to fully present their research and expertise, and for discussions to be truly constructive. Instead of dashing from the airport and between sessions, participants are to have a dignified possibility to show the results of their research and practice that has most often taken serious and long lasting efforts. Collegial interaction is another, almost equally relevant, creative and fruitful segment of a gathering, and here it will be allotted proper possibilities and time frame. The purpose of this gathering is to promote English for Specific Purposes (ESP), its rising importance and presence among the adult population of ELT, to exchange ideas and practices in this field. We invite scholars, lecturers, researchers, and students with experience and interest in this field to join us in summer 2017, at a showcase and exchange of cutting edge research and practice of ESP and language learning technologies. We invite submission proposals in the fields and the related areas of English for Specific and Academic Purposes, general and applied linguistics, associated language learning technologies.","date_start":"2017-07-03","date_end":"2017-07-07","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2017-04-15","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Arts & Humanities","Languages/Literature"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Nis","Serbia"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Nis","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Serbia"},"organizers":["University of Nis, Serbia"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
