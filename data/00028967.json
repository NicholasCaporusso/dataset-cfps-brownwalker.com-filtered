SOPO 2022 is co-organized by by Wuhan University, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, IPOC State Key Lab, and other institutions. SOPO is an annual conference in China since 2009\\. It was held in Wuhan, Chengdu, Shanghai, Suzhou, Xi’an, Beijing, Guilin, Sanya and Kunming from 2009 to 2021\\. Each year there are 100 - 200 attendees from Asia, Europe, America, etc., and there have been quite a lot of well known experts giving plenary speeches. In 2022, SOPO will be held from August 16 to 18 in Xiamen, China. It dedicates to facilitating the global development of Photonics and Optoelectronics and exploring ways in which the latest research results can be shared.
