In these networks, each node may be equipped with a variety of sensors, such as acoustic, seismic, infrared, motion, biomedical and chemical sensors with higher level of information inference associated with identification, embedded signal processing and networking of the data. This conference intends to be the meeting point of researchers and practitioners share experience and ideas on innovative developments in any aspect of sensor networks, including Hardware of Sensor Networks, Wireless Communication Protocols, Sensor Networks Software and Architectures, Wireless Information Networks, Data Manipulation, Signal Processing, Localization and Object Tracking through Sensor Networks, Obstacles, Applications and Uses. Conference Areas: Each of these topic areas is expanded below but the sub-topics list is not exhaustive. Papers may address one or more of the listed sub-topics, although authors should not feel limited by them. Unlisted but related sub-topics are also acceptable, provided they fit in one of the following main topic areas: 1\\. SENSOR NETWORKS SOFTWARE, ARCHITECTURES AND APPLICATIONS 2\\.
