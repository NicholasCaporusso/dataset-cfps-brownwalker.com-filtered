{"name":"2023 International Conference on Advances in Nanotechnology and Materials Science","series":"","short":"ICANMS2023","website":"https://icanms.apaset.edu.pl","content":"Welcome to the [**2023 International Conference on Advances in Nanotechnology and Materials Science (ICANMS2023)**](https://icanms.apaset.edu.pl/). This ICANMS 2023 will be held as a webinar virtual online. Website: <https://icanms.apaset.edu.pl/> \n \n Nanotechnology and materials science are two rapidly advancing fields with the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives. In recent years, there has been significant progress in both nanotechnology and materials science. New methods have been developed for synthesizing and manipulating nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, and metal nanoparticles. These nanomaterials have unique properties that make them ideal for a wide range of applications, including electronics, energy, and medicine. Meanwhile, new materials have been developed with unprecedented properties, such as strength, lightness, and conductivity. These new materials are being used to create new products and technologies, such as stronger aircraft, lighter cars, and more efficient solar cells. \n \n ICANMS aims to bring together leading researchers, industry experts, and students from all over the world to share and discuss the latest advances in these rapidly evolving fields. The conference will provide a platform for participants to network, collaborate, and learn from each other. The conference will also be a valuable forum for discussing the ethical and social implications of nanotechnology and materials science. \n \n The conference will cover a wide range of topics on Nanotechnology and Materials Science, including but not limited to: \n \\- Nanomaterials \n \\- Nanofabrication and nanomanufacturing \n \\- Nanoelectronics and nanophotonics \n \\- Nanomedicine and nanobiotechnology \n \\- Nanoenvironmental science and technology \n \\- Emerging topics in nanotechnology and materials science \n \\- Comprehensive application in Materials science \n \n ICANMS is a unique opportunity to learn about the latest research and developments in nanotechnology and materials science, network with leading experts in the field, and share your own research findings. We invite you to join us for this exciting event! \n \n We look forward to seeing you there! \n \n**ICANMS 2023 Organizing Committee** \n**Email**: icanms@apaset.org; icanms@apaset.edu.pl \n**Website**: <https://icanms.apaset.edu.pl/> ","date_start":"2023-10-28","date_end":"2023-10-30","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2023-10-27","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Material/Nanotechnology"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Online Event","Italy"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Online Event","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Italy"},"organizers":["Asia-Pacific Association of Science Engineering and Technology"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":["icanms@apaset.org","icanms@apaset.edu.pl"]}
