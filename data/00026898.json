Analytical Techniques Conferences mainly aims to promulgate knowledge in Analytical & Bio analytical Techniques, Chromatography, Separation Techniques, Mass Spectrometry and Spectroscopy. Both Pharmaceutical and Life science in course of research work and therefore this conference would be a perfect venue to share and develop knowledge on key Analytical Techniques tools. Analytical Chemistry 2021 focuses on all aspects concerned with the substances of which matter is composed, the investigation of their properties and reactions, and the use of such reactions to form new substances. This conference aims to provide a forum for researchers from various areas of chemical industry, food analysis, pharmacogenomics research, DNA analysis, method development and validation by providing a platform for critical analysis of new data, scope for analytic chemist and to share latest cutting-edge research findings and results about all aspects of Bio analytical and analytical chemistry.
