Current sharing of material takes the form of open access to uploaded lectures on Youtube, design models and source code on websites, and informal collaboration between local groups of educators. There is a need for identifying global commonalities in computer science curricula and establishing a framework of program/course outcomes that links to associated topics and material for teaching and assessment at the undergraduate level of university education. Such a proposed environment of sharable material will have applicability beyond small collaborative groups through broad-based international voluntary collaborative groups.","date_start":"2018-10-22","date_end":"2018-10-23","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2018-04-20","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Arts & Humanities","Other","Journalism"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Singapore","Singapore"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Singapore","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Singapore"},"organizers":["Global Science and technology Forum"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
