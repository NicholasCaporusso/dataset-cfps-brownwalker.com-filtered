{"name":"9th International Conference on Pattern Recognition Applications and Methods - ICPRAM 2020","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.icpram.org","content":"The International Conference on Pattern Recognition Applications and Methods would like to become a major point of contact between researchers, engineers and practitioners on the areas of Pattern Recognition, both from theoretical and application perspectives. Contributions describing applications of Pattern Recognition techniques to real-world problems, interdisciplinary research, experimental and/or theoretical studies yielding new insights that advance Pattern Recognition methods are especially encouraged. \n \n Papers describing original work are invited in any of the areas listed below. Accepted papers, presented at the conference by one of the authors, will be published in the proceedings of ICPRAM with an ISBN. Acceptance will be based on quality, relevance and originality. There will be both oral and poster sessions. \n \n Special sessions, dedicated to case-studies and commercial presentations, as well as technical tutorials, dedicated to technical/scientific topics, are also envisaged: companies interested in presenting their products/methodologies or researchers interested in presenting a demo or lecturing a tutorial are invited to contact the conference secretariat. \n \n Conference Topics: \n Area 1: Theory and Methods \n \\- Advanced Learning Methods \n \\- Linear Models and Dimensionality Reduction \n \\- Machine Learning Methods \n \\- Model Representation and Selection \n \\- Shape Representation \n \\- Signal Processing \n \\- Bayesian Models and Stochastic Methods \n \\- Case-Based Reasoning \n \\- Classification and Clustering \n \\- Deep Learning and Neural Networks \n \\- Ensemble Methods \n \\- Evolutionary Computation \n \\- Feature Selection and Extraction \n \\- Knowledge Acquisition and Representation \n \n Area 2: Applications \n \\- Audio and Speech Analysis \n \\- Motion Tracking and Action Recognition \n \\- Natural Language Processing \n \\- Robotics \n \\- Sensors and Early Vision \n \\- Virtual Environments \n \\- Bioinformatics and Systems Biology \n \\- Biometrics \n \\- Data Mining and Algorithms for Big Data \n \\- Document Analysis \n \\- Image and Video Analysis and Understanding \n \\- Industry Related Applications \n \\- Information Retrieval \n \\- Medical Imaging ","date_start":"2020-02-22","date_end":"2020-02-24","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2019-10-04","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Other"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Valletta","Malta"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Valletta","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Malta"},"organizers":["INSTICC"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
