{"name":"11th International Conference on Information Visualization Theory and Applications - IVAPP 2020","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.ivapp.visigrapp.org ","content":"The International Conference on Information Visualization Theory and Applications aims at becoming a major point of contact between researchers, engineers and practitioners in Information Visualization. The conference will be structured along several topics related to Information Visualization. We welcome papers describing original work in any of the topics listed below. Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques as well as general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Paper acceptance will be based on quality, relevance to the conference theme and originality. The conference program will include both oral and poster presentations. Special sessions, dedicated to case-studies and commercial presentations, as well as technical tutorials, dedicated to technical/scientific topics, are also envisaged. \n \n Conference Topics: \n Area 1: Abstract Data Visualization \n \\- Visual Data Analysis and Knowledge Discovery \n \\- Mathematical Foundations of Interactive Visual Analysis \n \\- Display and Interaction Technology \n \\- Databases and Visualization, Visual Data Mining \n \\- Graph Visualization \n \\- Interface and Interaction Techniques for Visualization \n \\- Internet, Web and Security Visualization \n \\- Software Visualization \n \\- Information Visualization \n \\- Visual Analytical Reasoning \n \\- Hardware-Assisted Visualization \n \\- High-Dimensional Data and Dimensionality Reduction \n \\- Text and Document Visualization \n \\- Visual Representation and Interaction \n \\- Data Management and Knowledge Representation \n \\- Explainable Machine Learning by Visualization \n Area 2: General Data Visualization \n \\- Interactive Visual Interfaces for Visualization \n \\- Perception and Cognition in Visualization \n \\- Visualization Applications \n \\- Visualization Taxonomies and Models \n \\- Visualization Algorithms and Technologies \n \\- Visualization Tools and Systems for Simulation and Modeling \n \\- Augmented Reality and Data Visualization \n \\- Mixed Reality and Data Visualization \n \\- Immersive Analytics \n \\- Time-Dependent Visualization \n \\- Usability Studies and Visualization \n \\- Glyph-Based Visualization \n \\- Human-Centered Aspects of Visualization \n \\- Coordinated and Multiple Views \n \\- Interpretation and Evaluation Methods \n \\- Knowledge-Assisted Visualization \n \\- Large Data Visualization \n \\- Integration of Data Analysis, Interaction, and Visualization \n \\- Data Driven Storytelling \n \n Area 3: Spatial Data Visualization \n \\- Biomedical Visualization and Applications \n \\- Vector/Tensor Field Visualization \n \\- Virtual Environments and Data Visualization \n \\- Volume Visualization \n \\- Scientific Visualization \n \\- Flow Visualization \n \\- GPU-based Visualization \n \\- Image/Video Summarization and Visualization \n \\- Multi-Field Visualization \n \\- Parallel Coordinate \n \\- Uncertainty Visualization ","date_start":"2020-02-27","date_end":"2020-02-29","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2019-10-04","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Valletta","Malta"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Valletta","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Malta"},"organizers":["INSTICC"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
