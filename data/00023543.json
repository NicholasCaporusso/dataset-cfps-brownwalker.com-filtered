{"name":"6th International Conference on Vehicle Technology and Intelligent Transport Systems - VEHITS 2020","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.vehits.org","content":"The purpose of the 6th International Conference on Vehicle Technology and Intelligent Transport Systems (VEHITS) is to bring together engineers, researchers and practitioners interested in the advances and applications in the field of Vehicle Technology and Intelligent Transport Systems. This conference focuses on innovative applications, tools and platforms in all technology areas such as signal processing, wireless communications, informatics and electronics, related to different kinds of vehicles, including cars, off-road vehicles, trains, ships, underwater vehicles, or flying machines, and the intelligent transportation systems that connect and manage large numbers of vehicles, not only in the context of smart cities but in many other application domains. Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques and general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Papers describing original work are invited in any of the areas listed below. Accepted papers, presented at the conference by one of the authors, will be published in the Proceedings of VEHITS. Acceptance will be based on quality, relevance and originality. Both full research reports and work-in-progress reports are welcome. There will be both oral and poster sessions. \n Special sessions, dedicated to case-studies and commercial presentations, as well as tutorials dedicated to technical/scientific topics are also envisaged: companies interested in presenting their products/methodologies or researchers interested in holding a tutorial, workshop or special session are invited to contact the conference secretariat or visit the VEHITS conference website. \n Conference Topics: \n Area 1: Connected Vehicles \n \\- Cooperative Driving and Traffic Management \n \\- Connected Services \n \\- Remote Diagnosis \n \\- Vehicle Telematics \n \\- Vehicular Cloud Computing \n \\- Mobility and the Internet of Vehicles \n \\- Big Data and Vehicle Analytics \n \\- V2V, V2I, V2X \n \\- Vehicular Networks \n \\- Security and Safety \n \\- Cognitive Radio \n \\- Communication Protocols \n Area 2: Data Analytics \n \\- Big Data & Vehicle Analytics \n \\- Traffic Management Reporting Systems \n \\- Decision Support Systems \n \\- Visualisation Approaches \n \\- Fleet Telematics \n \\- Analytics for Intelligent Transportation \n \\- Reporting Tools \n \\- Analytics and Optimization \n \\- User and Usage-Level Feedback \n \\- Vehicle Information Systems \n \\- Interaction Design for Analytics \n Area 3: Intelligent Transport Systems and Infrastructure \n \\- Big Data Analytics for Intelligent Transportation \n \\- Public Transportation Management \n \\- Parking Management and Electronic Parking \n \\- Intelligent Infrastructure and Guidance Systems \n \\- Traffic Theory, Modeling, and Simulation \n \\- Air, Road, and Rail Traffic Management \n \\- Ports and Vessel Traffic Management \n \\- Road Safety and Transport Security \n \\- Real-Time Incident Detection \n \\- Information Systems and Technologies \n \\- Wireless Sensor Networks \n \\- Automatic Tolls \n \\- Geographic Information Systems \n \\- Urban Mobility and Multimodal Transportation \n \\- Congestion Management and Avoidance \n Area 4: Intelligent Vehicle Technologies \n \\- Driver Behavior Analysis \n \\- Off the Road Vehicles \n \\- Traffic and Vehicle Data Collection and Processing \n \\- Navigation Systems \n \\- Autonomous Vehicles and Automated Driving \n \\- Vision and Image Processing \n \\- Vehicle Environment Perception \n \\- Pattern Recognition for Vehicles \n \\- Cognitive and Context-Aware Intelligence \n \\- Automotive Control and Mechatronics \n Area 5: Smart Mobility and Sustainable Transport Services - Transport for People with Disabilities - Alternative Fuels and Fuel Cell Vehicles - Electric Vehicles - Smart Grid and V2G - Hybrid EVs - Power Management - City Mobility and Ecodriving - Engine-Efficiency and Emissions Control - Systems Modeling and Simulation - Mobility for Growth - Automated Road Transport - Green Vehicles - Next Generation Batteries","date_start":"2020-05-02","date_end":"2020-05-04","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2019-12-13","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Transportation"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Prague","Czech Republic"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Prague","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Czech Republic"},"organizers":["INSTICC"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
