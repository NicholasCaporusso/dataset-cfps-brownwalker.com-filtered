There is, however, little evidence to suggest that older people today are experiencing their later years in better health than their parents. While rates of severe disability have declined in high-income countries over the past 30 years, there has been no significant change in mild to moderate disability over the same period. Challenges and concerns in relation to an aging society are being faced with and actions must be taken, in order to create a more suitable environment for the growing elderly. Therefore, it is important to address the issues of having health care and medical support which to meet the needs of a silver age.
