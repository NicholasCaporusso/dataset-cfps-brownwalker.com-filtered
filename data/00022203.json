{"name":"9th International Conference on Sensor Networks - SENSORNETS 2020","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.sensornets.org/ ","content":"The use of sensors is familiar to citizens as they are incorporated in many devices including smartphones, vehicles, appliances, smartwatches, among others. The use of sensor networks is spreading faster everyday, and some examples are their application in agriculture, health, energy, environment, industry, smart cities, etc. These sensors are usually part of a set of sensors, which are interconnected with each other, and usually with a coordinating (sink) node. Depending on the application and the types of sensors that interact or from which information is collected, the links will be established using different standards depending on requirements: range, bandwidth, power consumption, etc.. Due to its configuration flexibility and lower deployment cost, wireless sensor networks have become the most popular. \n Nevertheless, several issues and challenges must be faced by engineers to guarantee the highest QoS, as security, channel reliability, battery life, interoperability with other networks, etc. Sensor networks performance rely on several impacting factors which must be investigated: network architecture, operating system, hardware implementation, radio interface, protocols, sensors technology, which must be optimized to achieve the highest availability, reliability, throughput and power saving. \n In these networks, each node may be equipped with a variety of sensors, such as acoustic, seismic, infrared, motion, biomedical and chemical sensors with higher level of information inference associated with identification, embedded signal processing and networking of the data. This conference intends to be the meeting point of researchers and practitioners to share experiences and ideas on innovative developments in any aspect of sensor networks, including Hardware of Sensor Networks, Wireless Communication Protocols, Sensor Networks Software, Hardware and Architectures, Wireless Information Networks, Channel Characterization, Data Manipulation, Signal Processing, Localization and Object Tracking through Sensor Networks, Modelling and Simulation, Applications and Uses. \n Papers describing original work are invited in any of the areas listed below. Accepted papers, presented at the conference by one of the authors, will be published in the proceedings of SENSORNETS. Acceptance will be based on quality, relevance and originality. There will be both oral and poster sessions. Special sessions, dedicated to case-studies and commercial presentations, as well as technical tutorials, dedicated to technical/scientific topics, are also envisaged. \n Conference Topics: \n Area 1: Energy and Environment \n \\- Energy Efficiency \n \\- Environment Monitoring \n \\- Geospatial Knowledge Management Systems \n \\- Green Sensor Networks \n \\- Industrial and Structural Monitoring \n \\- Remote Sensing and Telemetry \n \\- Smart Grids and Energy Control Systems \n \n Area 2: Intelligent Data Analysis and Processing \n \\- Aggregation, Classification and Tracking \n \\- Big Data \n \\- Computational Intelligence \n \\- Artificial intelligence and machine learning \n \\- Data Quality and Integrity \n \\- Image Processing \n \\- Information Retrieval and Data Mining \n \\- Multi-Sensor Data Processing \n \\- Pattern Recognition \n \\- Reasoning on Sensor Data \n \\- Sensor Data Fusion & Deep Learning \n \\- Statistical and Adaptive Signal Processing \n \n Area 3: Security and Privacy in Sensor Networks \n \\- Authentication \n \\- Biometric Systems \n \\- Cryptography \n \\- Defense and Security \n \\- Fault Tolerance and Diagnosis \n \\- Infrastructure Reliability \n \\- Security Threats \n \\- Vulnerability and Privacy \n \\- Wireless Surveillance \n \n Area 4: Wireless Sensor Networks \n \\- Ad Hoc Networks \n \\- Connected Vehicles \n \\- Cross-Layer Design \n \\- Network Performance \n \\- Network Topologies \n \\- Power Management \n \\- Routing Techniques \n \n Area 5: Wireless Sensor Networks and Architectures \n \\- Technologies and Standards: WiFi, Zigbee, LoRa, Bluetooth \n \\- Wearable Computing and Body Area Networks \n \\- Wired and Wireless Sensor Systems: Signals, Transceivers, and Interfaces \n \\- Wireless Network Protocols \n \\- Mobility Models \n \\- Heterogeneous networks \n \\- Energy Efficiency \n \\- Energy Harvesting \n \n Area 6: Sensors Networks Hardware \n \\- Optical Sensors \n \\- Physical Sensors: Temperature, Mechanical, Magnetic, and Other \n \\- Biosensors \n \\- Human-Computer Interfaces \n \\- Embedded Systems \n \\- Energy efficient protocols \n \n Area 7: Sensor Networks Software \n \\- Modeling, Simulation and Platforms \n \\- Operating Systems \n \\- Performace optimizatioin \n \\- Multi-Agent Systems \n \\- Programming and Middleware \n \\- Scheduling, Tasking and Control \n \n Area 8: Sensor Networks Applications \n \\- Ambient Assisted Living \n \\- Cloud Computing \n \\- Connectivity and Communication \n \\- Decision Support \n \\- Home Monitoring \n \\- Healthcare Applications \n \\- Internet of Things \n \\- Smart Cities \n \\- Industry ","date_start":"2020-02-28","date_end":"2020-02-29","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2019-10-04","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Valletta","Malta"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Valletta","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Malta"},"organizers":["INSTICC"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
