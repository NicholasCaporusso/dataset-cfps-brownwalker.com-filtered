Current information age is witnessing a dramatic use of digital and electronic devices in the workplace and beyond. Ubiquitous Computing presents a rather arduous requirement of robustness, reliability and availability to the end user. Ubiquitous computing has received a significant and sustained research interest in terms of designing and deploying large scale and high performance computational applications in real life. The aim of the conference is to provide a platform to the researchers and practitioners from both academia as well as industry to meet and share cutting-edge development in the field. Authors are solicited to contribute to the conference by submitting articles that illustrate research results, projects, surveying works and industrial experiences that describe significant advances in the following areas, but are not limited to. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: · Architectural Structure, Design Decisions and Philosophies · Autonomic Management of Ubiquitous Systems · Based and Implicit Computing · Context and Location Awareness, Context · Dependable, Reliable and Autonomic Computing · Distributed Computing · Intelligent Devices and Environments · Internet Computing and Applications · Interoperability and Large Scale Deployment · Middleware Services and Agent Technologies · Mobile Computing · Network Protocols & Wireless Communication · Personalized & Special Field Applications · Security Issues and Applications · Service Discovery Mechanisms and Protocols · Software Infrastructures · System Support Infrastructures and Services · Ubicomp Human-Computer Interaction for Devices · Ubiquitous Systems and Trust · User Interfaces and Interaction Models · Virtualization Over Networks of Devices · Wearable Computers and Technologies · Wireless Networking and Mobile, Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing · Wireless/Mobile Service Management and Delivery Paper Submission Authors are invited to submit papers through the conference Submission System by September 24, 2023 . Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for this conference. The proceedings of the conference will be published by Computer Science Conference Proceedings in Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT) series (Confirmed). Selected papers from UBIC 2023, after further revisions, will be published in the special issues of the following journals · International Journal of Computer Networks & Communications (IJCNC) - Scopus, WJCI, ERA Indexed · International Journal of UbiComp (IJU) · International Journal of Ad hoc, Sensor & Ubiquitous Computing (IJASUC) · Information Technology in Industry (ITII) Important Dates · Submission Deadline : September 24, 2023 · Authors Notification : October 18, 2023 · Registration & Camera-Ready Paper Due : October 25, 2023 Contact Us Here's where you can reach us :ubic@iccsea2023.org or ubicconference@yahoo.com Submission Link https://iccsea2023.org/submission/index.php","date_start":"2023-12-23","date_end":"2023-12-24","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2023-09-24","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Sydney","Australia","Australia"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Sydney","state":"Australia","ZIP":"","country":"Australia"},"organizers":[""],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":["ubic@iccsea2023.org","ubicconference@yahoo.com"]}
