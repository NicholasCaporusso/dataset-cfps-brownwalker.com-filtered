{"name":"2nd International Workshop on Architectures for Future Mobile Computing and Internet of Things","series":"","short":"","website":"http://fmciot2019.lacl.fr","content":"Mobile phones and Internet of Things (IoT) devices are the top two largest categories of connected devices in 2018\\. With more than 15% compound annual growth rate, they are considered as one of today's hottest trends in both academia and industry. Both Mobile phones and IoT devices integrates different major technologies such as cloud services, big data, cloud computing, and wireless networking (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, 5G, â€¦) in one platform that services the end users. According to Ericcson, there will be a total of approximately 28B connected devices worldwide by 2021 fairly distributed between Mobile phones and IoT devices. Despite this rapid growth, many issues at the intersection of Mobile computing and IoT are still challenging and need to be addressed. These challenges are related to the underlying communication networks, interaction with cloud services, security, the required Quality of Service, the availability of services, integration with next generation internet technologies, and many others. The FMCIoT 2019 Workshop aims at soliciting original ideas on the broad area of Mobile and IoT architectures including challenges and opportunities, concepts, applications, and future trends that address the aforementioned challenges. The Workshop aims to facilitate discussions among academics and industry to bridge Mobile Computing and IoT practitioners and make positive contributions to the field.
