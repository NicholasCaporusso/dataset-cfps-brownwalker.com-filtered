{"name":"International Conference on Industry 4.0","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.myindustries.org","content":"International Conference in Industry 4.0: A Global Revolution in Business, Technology, and Productivity (MYINDUSTRIES 2019) will be from 5th – 7th September 2019 at SEGi University, Malaysia. Through its technical program, the conference aims to provide an outstanding opportunity for both academic and industrial communities alike to address new trends and challenges, emerging technologies and progress in standards on topics relevant to today’s fast-moving areas of Industry 4.0\\. A new revolution known as Industry 4.0 is occurring where countless elements comprising industrial systems are being interfaced with internet communication technologies to form the smart factories and manufacturing organisations of the future. Industry 4.0 and its associated technologies are currently being driven by disruptive innovation that promises to bring countless new value creation opportunities across all major market sectors. However, existing Internet technologies are plagued by cyber security and data privacy issues that will present major challenges and roadblocks for adopters of Industry 4.0 technologies. Industry 4.0 will face traditional cyber security issues along with its very own unique security and privacy challenges. If these challenges are not appropriately addressed, the true potential of Industry 4.0 may never be achieved. This chapter provides a brief overview of several key Industry 4.0 technologies and paradigms in order to give the reader a better understanding of the cyber security aspects of the remaining chapters in the book. It’s no secret that Industry 4.0, or the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has the power to drive true quantifiable change in both manufacturing and service-based industries. The immediate bottom-line benefits are clear: fewer machine failures, reduced scrap and downtime issues, and improved throughput – to name a few. However, there are additional, less quantifiable, benefits of implementing this technology. • Technology Trends • Internet of Things • Blockchain • Big Data • Smart Cities • Machine to Machine • Neuromorphic Systems • Data Analytics • Mobile Applications • Digital Transformation • Software Engineering and Quality • Artificial Intelligence • Deep Learning • Neural Networks • Fuzzy Logic • Expert Systems • Agents and Multi-agent Systems • Natural Language Processing • Data Mining • Support Vector Machines • Ambient Intelligence • Sentiment Analysis • Business • Productivity • Market Intelligence • Process Management • Sustainability • Green Technology • Big Data Analysis Economics • Business Model Innovation • Decision Support System • New Services & Ecosystem • Leadership in the Millennium • Integrated Management • Innovation • New Revenue Models • New Startup • Infrastructure Management • Machine Vision • Robotics • Human Computer Interaction • Computer Vision • Image Processing • Geographic Information Systems • Video Analysis • Medical Diagnosis • Segmentation Techniques • Augmented Reality • Virtual Reality • Computing • Quantum Computing • Digital Transformation • High Performance Computing • Distributed and parallel systems • Social Computing • Cloud Computing • Grid Computing • Human-centred Computing • Mobile Computing • Large-scale applications • Communication • Networking • Wireless/ Mobile Communication • Satellite Communication Systems • 3G/4G/5G Network Evolutions • Connected Machines • Mobile Adhoc Networks • Open Spectrum Solutions • Communication Protocols • Cognitive Radio • Mobile Apps • Security • Cyber Security • Networking • Wireless/ Mobile Communication • Satellite Communication Systems • 3G/4G/5G Network Evolutions • Connected Machines • Mobile Adhoc Networks • Open Spectrum Solutions • Communication Protocols • Cognitive Radio • Mobile Apps • E-Learning • e-Learning Tools • Mobile Learning • e-Learning Organisational Issues • Gamification • Collaborative Learning • Curriculum Content Design • Educational Systems Design • Virtual Learning Environments • Web-based Learning • Delivery Systems and Environments • Electronics • Nanotechnologies • Smart Grids • Sensing and Sensor Networks • Power Electronics • Digital Circuits • Analogue Circuits & Signal Processing • Design Automation • Computer and Control Systems • Factory Automation • Motion Control • Healthcare • AI in Medical field & Dental • Blockchain for Healthcare • Internet of Medical Things (IOMT) • Drug Management • Big Data & AI • Smart Biosciences • Smart Medical Devices • Medical Robots • Predictive Analytics","date_start":"2019-09-05","date_end":"2019-09-07","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2019-06-30","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Electrical/ Electronic"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["SEGi University No. 9","Jalan Teknologi","Taman Sains Sela","Malaysia"],"name":"","street":"","city":"","state":"","ZIP":"","country":""},"organizers":["http://www.myindustries.org/"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
