{"name":"22nd International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems - ICEIS 2020","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.iceis.org","content":"The purpose of the 22nd International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems (ICEIS) is to bring together researchers, engineers and practitioners interested in the advances and business applications of information systems. Six simultaneous tracks will be held, covering different aspects of Enterprise Information Systems Applications, including Enterprise Database Technology, Systems Integration, Artificial Intelligence, Decision Support Systems, Information Systems Analysis and Specification, Internet Computing, Electronic Commerce, Human Factors and Enterprise Architecture. ICEIS focuses on real world applications; therefore authors should highlight the benefits of Information Technology for industry and services. Ideas on how to solve business problems, using IT, will arise from the conference. Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques and general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Papers describing original work are invited in any of the areas listed below. Accepted papers, presented at the conference by one of the authors, will be published in the Proceedings of ICEIS. Acceptance will be based on quality, relevance and originality. Both full research reports and work-in-progress reports are welcome. There will be both oral and poster sessions. Workshops, providing a more interactive and focused platform for presenting and discussing new and emerging ideas or special sessions, dedicated to case-studies and commercial presentation are also envisaged: companies interested in presenting their products/methodologies or researchers interested in holding a tutorial are invited to contact the conference secretariat. \n Conference Topics: \n Area 1: Databases and Information Systems Integration \n \\- Coupling and Integrating Heterogeneous Data Sources \n \\- Legacy Systems \n \\- Organisational Issues on Systems Integration \n \\- Mobile Databases \n \\- Enterprise Resource Planning \n \\- Middleware Integration \n \\- Databases in the Cloud \n \\- Data Mining \n \\- Data Warehouses and OLAP \n \\- Performance Evaluation and Benchmarking \n \\- Large Scale Databases \n \\- Non-Relational Databases \n \\- Query Languages and Query Processing \n \\- Distributed Database Systems \n Area 2: Artificial Intelligence and Decision Support Systems \n \\- Evolutionary Programming \n \\- Group Decision Support Systems \n \\- Industrial Applications of Artificial Intelligence \n \\- Strategic Decision Support Systems \n \\- Advanced Applications of Neural Network \n \\- Applications of Expert Systems \n \\- Advanced Applications of Fuzzy Logic \n \\- Intelligent Agents \n \\- Case-Based Reasoning Systems \n \\- Multi-Agent Systems \n \\- Scheduling and Planning \n \\- Operational Research \n \\- Problem Solving \n \\- Game Theory Applications \n \\- Intelligent Transportation System \n \\- Natural Language Interfaces and Systems \n Area 3: Information Systems Analysis and Specification \n \\- Software Engineering \n \\- Knowledge Management \n \\- Modelling of Distributed Systems \n \\- Ontology Engineering \n \\- Security \n \\- Simulation \n \\- Requirements Analysis and Management \n \\- Tools, Techniques and Methodologies for System Development \n \\- Model Driven Architectures and Engineering \n \\- Modelling Formalisms, Languages, and Notations (E.G.
