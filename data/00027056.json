{"name":"Development of generics: From R&D to GMP MasterClass","series":"","short":"","website":"https://glceurope.com/development-of-generics-from-rd-to-gmp-masterclass-details-3/?utm_source=brownwalker&utm_medium=media_partner&utm_campaign=DGGMPMC3","content":"The interface between Development and GMP units is one of the most exciting in the pharmaceutical industry. Mutual understanding of the different regulatory environment and the functional priorities is a key success factor. Conflicts, mostly resulting from different approaches and priorities, can have negative impact on business processes even outside the R&D or GMP areas. R&D needs flexibility and should not be over-regulated, whereas GMP concentrates on standardization and high throughput. On the other hand, R&D has to create a solid and robust fundament to enable manufacturing and quality control to work according to established and efficient procedures. The training aims to generate a common understanding of how to best interlink these two areas and create highly efficient processes from product development to routine manufacturing of generic pharmaceutical products.","date_start":"2021-05-10","date_end":"2021-05-11","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Medicine & Health","Pharmaceutical / Medicinal","medicine & medical science"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Online Event","Hungary"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Online Event","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Hungary"},"organizers":["GLC Europe"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
