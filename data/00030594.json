Current information age is witnessing a dramatic use of digital and electronic devices in the workplace and beyond. Ubiquitous Computing presents a rather arduous requirement of robustness, reliability and availability to the end user. Ubiquitous computing has received a significant and sustained research interest in terms of designing and deploying large scale and high performance computational applications in real life. The aim of the conference is to provide a platform to the researchers and practitioners from both academia as well as industry to meet and share cutting-edge development in the field. Authors are solicited to contribute to the conference by submitting articles that illustrate research results, projects, surveying works and industrial experiences that describe significant advances in the following areas, but are not limited to. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: • Architectural Structure, Design Decisions and Philosophies • Autonomic Management of Ubiquitous Systems • Context and Location Awareness, Context Based and Implicit Computing • Distributed Computing • Ubicomp Human-Computer Interaction for Devices • Intelligent Devices and Environments • Internet Computing and Applications • Interoperability and Large Scale Deployment • Middleware Services and Agent Technologies • Dependable, Reliable and Autonomic Computing • Personalized & Special Field Applications • Security Issues and Applications • Service Discovery Mechanisms and Protocols • Software Infrastructures • System Support Infrastructures and Services • Ubiquitous Systems and Trust • User Interfaces and Interaction Models • Virtualization Over Networks of Devices • Wearable Computers and Technologies • Wireless Networking and Mobile, Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing • Wireless/Mobile Service Management and Delivery • Mobile Computing • Network Protocols & Wireless Communication Paper Submission Authors are invited to submit papers through the conference Submission System by August 27, 2022\\. Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for this conference. The proceedings of the conference will be published by Computer Science Conference Proceedings in Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT) series (Confirmed). Selected papers from UBIC 2022, after further revisions, will be published in the special issues of the following journals • International Journal of Computer Networks & Communications (IJCNC) - Scopus, WJCI, ERA Indexed • International Journal of UbiComp (IJU)) • International Journal of Ad hoc, Sensor & Ubiquitous Computing (IJASUC) • Information Technology in Industry (ITII) Important Dates • Submission Deadline : August 27, 2022 • Authors Notification : September 25, 2022 • Registration & Camera-Ready Paper Due : October 04, 2022 Contact Us Here's where you can reach us : ubic@iccsea2022.org or ubicconference@yahoo.com Submission URL : https://iccsea2022.org/submission/index.php","date_start":"2022-11-26","date_end":"2022-11-27","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2022-08-27","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Electrical/ Electronic","Environmental Chemistry"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["London UK","United Kingdom"],"name":"","street":"","city":"London UK","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"United Kingdom"},"organizers":[""],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":["ubic@iccsea2022.org","ubicconference@yahoo.com"]}
