{"name":"GSTF CSEIT - 8th Annual International Conference On Computer Science Education: Innovation and Technology","series":"","short":"","website":"http://cseducation.org","content":"To fulfill the country's objectives, a country needs to organize and improve its education systems. One area of education that has undergone profound change and significant progress is computer education. Comprehensive Education Programs have been created and implemented. As computing evolves, so does Computer Science as a discipline. This puts continual pressure on Computer Science educators to review, revise and rewrite the courses and the curriculum. Educators have been rising up to the challenge, creating new courses, introducing innovative ideas and practices into existing courses, re-organizing the major and carve out minors. Computer education forms a part of the school and college curriculum, as it is important for every individual today, to have basic knowledge of computers. Innovation is expensive. Change takes time, effort and commitment. The conference is designed to spark discussion among creative educators, researchers, consultants, training managers, policy makers, curriculum developers, entrepreneurs, and others in Computer Science Education. Many individuals are transforming learning environments in local as well as more global ways. This conference offers an opportunity to meet and discuss their ideas, findings, and next steps.","date_start":"2017-10-09","date_end":"2017-10-10","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2017-05-31","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics","computer science"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["singapore","Singapore"],"name":"","street":"","city":"singapore","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Singapore"},"organizers":["Global Science and Technology Forum"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
