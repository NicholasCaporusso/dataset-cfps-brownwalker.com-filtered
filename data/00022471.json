{"name":"10th International Conference on High Performance and Optimum Design of Structures and Materials","series":"","short":"","website":"https://www.wessex.ac.uk/conferences/2020/hpsm-opti-2020","content":"\\*Status Update\\* Please note that following the recent events on the Coronavirus pandemic and with the main objective to preserve the well being of our delegates, WIT has decided to postpone the HPSM/OPTI 2020 conference until after the summer break. The conference was due to be held 3-5 June 2020 in Prague, Czech Republic and will now be held 2-4 September 2020 in Prague, Czech Republic. \\*\\*\\* The conference addresses issues involving advanced types of structures, particularly those based on new concepts or new materials and their system design. Contributions will highlight the latest development in design, optimisation, manufacturing and experimentation in those areas. The meeting also aims to search for higher performance sustainable materials. Most high performance structures require the development of a generation of new materials, which can more easily resist a range of external stimuli or react in a non-conventional manner. Particular emphasis will be placed on intelligent structures and materials as well as the application of computational methods for their modelling, control and management.","date_start":"2020-09-02","date_end":"2020-09-04","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2020-05-02","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Architectural/Environmental","Urban Studies, Planning & Design"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Prague","Czech Republic"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Prague","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Czech Republic"},"organizers":["Wessex Institute"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
