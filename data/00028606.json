{"name":"International Conference on Poetry Studies: “Poetry Between Creation and Interpretation“","series":"","short":"","website":"https://poetry.lcir.co.uk","content":"Poetry is a constant, being produced by all known civilisations from ancient to modern times. Throughout its extensive history, the individual art of high emotions sublimated into perfect language has approached a vast array of subject matters, including love, war, social issues, the beauty of nature, etc. A particular exercise of the mind and soul, and a unique way of apprehending reality, poetry is a self-sufficient universe that intensifies and enlarges life experience. Pointing to inner knowledge rather than real circumstance, it activates different layers of perception, sweeps away human thoughts, feeds emotions and soothes suffering. Poetry inspires as well as instructs, as it is an initiation into the concealed order of the world. Its intense gratification, unrivalled in authenticity and honesty, appeals to human nature and makes ultimate sense of the self, opening the individual to interaction and communication. Poetry ennobles, enlightens and entertains because its expressive boundaries are virtually unlimited. With the help of translation, it goes beyond strict localisation and cultural arbitrariness, generating a sense of spiritual compatibility and communion between the collective identities of the world. The conference aims to bring together international poets, literary critics, translators and scholars from diverse contexts and interdisciplinary fields to share their work. As the 2021 edition is dedicated to issues related to poetry, poetics and translation, we invite papers, presentations, manuscripts, panels, roundtables, performances, and other forms of contributions relevant to the areas of investigation. Paper proposals up to 250 words and a brief biographical note should be sent by 15 December 2021 to: poetry@lcir.co.uk. Please download the paper proposal form on our website: https://poetry.lcir.co.uk Selected papers will be published in a peer-reviewed eBook volume with an ISBN number.","date_start":"2022-03-26","date_end":"2022-03-27","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2021-12-15","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Arts & Humanities","Languages/Literature"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Oxford University","United Kingdom"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Oxford University","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"United Kingdom"},"organizers":["London Centre for Interdisciplinary Research"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":["poetry@lcir.co.uk"]}
