Currently, the technology is not only the great tool in basic research, such as cell biology, genetics, biochemistry and biotechnology, but has also the direct commercial importance in the mass propagation, production of doubled haploids, secondary metabolites, genetic transformation, etc. The 2nd International Conference \"Plant Cells In Vitro: Fundamentals and Applications\" to be held on June 26-27, 2017, in Vienna, Austria will discuss wide range of modern in vitro plant cell and organ culture technologies, fundamental aspects of plant cell totipotency, differentiation, regeneration, embryogeneisis, and practical applications of in vitro technologies for crop improvement.","date_start":"2017-06-26","date_end":"2017-06-27","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2017-04-01","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Life Sciences","Plant-Biology","Plant science, biology and genetics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Vienna","Austria"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Vienna","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Austria"},"organizers":["Vienna International Science Conferences & Events Association (VISCEA)"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
