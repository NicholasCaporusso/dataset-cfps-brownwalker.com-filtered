{"name":"O'Reilly Open Source Software Conference","series":"","short":"OSCON","website":"https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or","content":"OSCON: Ground Zero for the evolution of Open Source. For over 20 years, OSCON has been the focal point of the open source movement. The inception of OSCON came from an event focused on Perl and grew to cover the other scripting languages. It has since evolved into the destination for all things free and open. The event has also provided a platform for the launch of major initiatives such as Kubernetes 1.0 and OpenStackâ€”both announced at OSCON. Today, OSCON continues to be the catalyst for innovation, bringing together large corporations and grass-roots communities to share insights and foster change. Open source helps technology to thrive, and OSCON continues on with the tradition of bringing you the latest technological advances and a path to successfully implement open source in your workflow.","date_start":"2020-07-13","date_end":"2020-07-16","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2020-01-14","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics","Information technology systems (IT)"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Portland","United States"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Portland","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"United States"},"organizers":["O'Reilly Media"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
