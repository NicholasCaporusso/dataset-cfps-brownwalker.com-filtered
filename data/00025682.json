How do performance management, recruitment, learning and development, compensation and benefits, and the way we perform employee engagement surveys change? What are the specific skills that we need to use to run an agile transformation from a people perspective? And is there still a need to do succession planning in the future? The training places great emphasis on practical examples and we will present a series of tools that you will be able to use when getting started on your own agile HR initiative. We take you through an agile HR case from setting goals and developing user stories for HR to implementing sprint planning and monitoring the sprint using Kanban.","date_start":"2020-10-22","date_end":"2020-10-23","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Business","Human-Resources","Human Resource Management"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Online Event","Hungary"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Online Event","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Hungary"},"organizers":["GLC Europe"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
