{"name":"Gender Research Workshop: “The Female Gaze in Cinema”","series":"","short":"","website":"https://genderstudies.lcir.co.uk/gender-research-workshop-female-gaze","content":"Film has long been a male-dominated industry, but for decades female directors against all odds have made an indelible mark on cinema. Today there is growing recognition of the important contributions made by women to the world of moving image, with audiences calling for more opportunities to be given to female screenwriters, cinematographers, editors, producers, performers and directors in a bid to defeat gender inequality. In this session we will identify psychoanalytic themes contained in films directed by women, placing a special focus on the feminine experience portrayed in stories told by women. There will be an opportunity to collectively discuss the ways in which cinema can evolve in order to more authentically depict female desire, fears and subjectivity. The following films will be discussed (advance viewing is optional): A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014) Ana Lily Amirpour Risk (2016) dir. Laura Poitras Romance (1999) Catherine Breillat Augustine (2012) Alice Winocour Lost in Translation (2003) Sofia Coppola The Wolfpack (2015) Crystal Moselle Mary Wild is the creator of the PROJECTIONS lecture series at Freud Museum London, applying psychoanalysis to film interpretation. Her interests include cinematic representations of mental illness, doppelgängers and the unconscious in the genres of horror, science fiction and documentary. Mary also co-hosts the PROJECTIONS Podcast available on iTunes and Spotify. The workshop is designed for students, young scholars and independent researchers with a particular interest related to gender studies. It will allow them to deepen theoretical and methodological knowledge and critical thinking in gender studies. All the registered participants who will attend the workshop will receive certificates.
