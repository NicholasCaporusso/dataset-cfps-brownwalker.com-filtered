The 2021 Conference will be our TENTH year as we gather together on a virtual platform from all corners of the world. Along with the herbal education and personal growth workshops, women enjoy meditation and body movement opportunities, singing, and virtual nature walks. The virtual village communes together around nourishment and the sharing of wisdom. With pre-conference workshops, a lively marketplace, and a long list of exciting instructors, we are sure there will be something for everyone. Beginning with a welcoming opening ceremony, bringing together the group intentions, each personal journey continues while held in the trusting and mysterious arms of nature (and zoom!). We encourage breaks throughout the weekend for you to curate delicious meals and get outside regularly.","date_start":"2021-05-07","date_end":"2021-05-09","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Medicine & Health","Other","Food and Nutrition"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Online Event","United States"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Online Event","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"United States"},"organizers":["Midwest Women's herbal"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
