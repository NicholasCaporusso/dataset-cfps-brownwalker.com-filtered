Introduction SOPO is an annual conference in China since 2009\\. It was held in Wuhan, Chengdu, Shanghai, Suzhou, Xi'an, Beijing and Guilin from 2009 to 2018\\. Each year there are 100 - 200 attendees from Asia, Europe, America, etc., and there have been quite a lot of well known experts giving plenary speeches. In 2019, SOPO will be held from August 17 to 19 in Xi'an, China. It dedicates to facilitating the global development of Photonics and Optoelectronics and exploring ways in which the latest research results can be shared. SOPO 2019 is co-organized by Wuhan University, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, IPOC State Key Lab and other institutions.
