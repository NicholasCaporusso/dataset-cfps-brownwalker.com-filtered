The ANTSHE conference provides attendees with the opportunity to experience engaging content, networking, and valuable, high quality education. ANTSHE promises in 2019 to deliver the same kind of high quality conference experience that our attendees have come to expect, with more than 100 presentations by colleagues representing all sectors of higher education, roundtable discussions, an academic leadership panel featuring some of the top leaders in higher education today, and an Exhibit Hall featuring the latest tools and resources for colleges/universities who support adult learners. Did I mention that the ANTSHE conference also holds a student leadership panel discussion as well? Our adult learners not only attend, but they also participate, and they provide us with even more insight into their lives and what was/is required in order for them to reach their educational degree goals.","date_start":"2019-04-04","date_end":"2019-04-06","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2018-12-15","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Education / Legal / Other","Education","call for papers"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Orlando","Florida","United States"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Orlando","state":"Florida","ZIP":"","country":"United States"},"organizers":["Association for Non-Traditional Students in Higher Education"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
