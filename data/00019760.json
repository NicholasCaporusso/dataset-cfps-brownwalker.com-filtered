{"name":"Flow Chemistry and New Flow Chemistry Masterclass, Austria, 2019","series":"","short":"","website":"https://go.evvnt.com/323770-3?pid=4868","content":"Flow chemistry has been used in petrochemical and bulk chemical production for over 100 years, but has only seen significant interest in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries in the past 10 years. This course aims to give an introduction to this exciting and revolutionary field, to familiarise attendees with the current state of the art. A wide range of highlights from the flow chemistry literature will be discussed, from both academia and industry, with a focus on translating conventional reactions to flow processes. Attendees will become familiar with a number of distinct types of flow reactors, allowing the correct reactor to be chosen to suit the required chemistry. Emphasis will also be placed on the inline and online monitoring of flow reactions, along with the hazards and pitfalls associated with scaling up flow reactions.
