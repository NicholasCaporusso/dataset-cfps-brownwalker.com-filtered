This year GPB 2022 will be carried out as a hybrid event, with both onsite and online version. This preeminent interdisciplinary congress will emphasize on the latest advancements in plant science with key focus on the theme “From Soil to Fork: Neoteric Innovations and Challenges in Plant Science.” The conference showcases the work of the plant research community through a balanced collection of oral and poster presentations. In the previous 5 editions there were more than 200 participants each from 54 countries, and the event was increasingly concerned to discuss and communicate new findings in plant biotechnology, plant pathologists, plant science experts and policymakers. In presenting and discussing their work and results we gladly invite scholars from all around the world to make their contribution to a vibrant, successful and safe conference. At this conference we will promote interdisciplinary debates and collaborations in this exciting field of plant science research on the latest and new topics.","date_start":"2022-03-24","date_end":"2022-03-26","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2022-03-22","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Life Sciences","Biotechnology/ Bioinformatics","Plant science, biology and genetics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Singapore"],"name":"","street":"","city":"","state":"","ZIP":"","country":""},"organizers":["Magnus Group"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
