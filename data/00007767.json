{"name":"The 8th International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Information Retrieval","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.kdir.ic3k.org","content":"Scope: Knowledge Discovery is an interdisciplinary area focusing upon methodologies for identifying valid, novel, potentially useful and meaningful patterns from data, often based on underlying large data sets. A major aspect of Knowledge Discovery is data mining, i.e. applying data analysis and discovery algorithms that produce a particular enumeration of patterns (or models) over the data. Knowledge Discovery also includes the evaluation of patterns and identification of which add to knowledge. Information retrieval (IR) is concerned with gathering relevant information from unstructured and semantically fuzzy data in texts and other media, searching for information within documents and for metadata about documents, as well as searching relational databases and the Web. Automation of information retrieval enables the reduction of what has been called \"information overload\". Information retrieval can be combined with knowledge discovery to create software tools that empower users of decision support systems to better understand and use the knowledge underlying large data sets. KDIR is part of IC3K, the 8th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management. IC3K 2016 will be held in conjunction with IJCCI 2016\\. IC3K KEYNOTE LECTURES IC3K 2016 will have several invited keynote speakers, who are internationally recognized experts in their areas. Their names are not yet confirmed.
