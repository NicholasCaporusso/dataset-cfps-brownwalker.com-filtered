The event offers a premier interdisciplinary platform for researchers, practitioners and educators to present and discuss the most recent innovations, trends, and concerns as well as practical challenges encountered and solutions adopted in the fields of MNPs pollution. Publication Accepted full papers will be published on the book series Springer Proceedings in Earth and Environmental Sciences (SPEES) that indexed by Scopus. Call for Papers Prospective authors (Scientists, academicians, researchers, decision makers, government officials…etc) are kindly encouraged to contribute to and help shape the roundtable webinar through submissions of their research abstracts, papers and e-posters.Prospective authors are requested to submit quality research articles on the MNPs pollution, and key topics can be but not limited to: • Plastic and microplastic pollution and associated contaminants • Microfibers and nanoplastics from textiles • Effect of micro and nanoplastics on human health • Innovative solutions to mitigate microplastic pollution • Degradation of microplastics • Sources, fate and effects of micro and nanoplastics • Socioeconomic and environmental impact assessment and risk analysis • Sampling, extraction, purification and identification approaches for micro and nanoplastics • Ecotoxicological effects of microplastics and nanoplastics • Ecotoxicological characterisation of nano and microplastics(Including degradation products-leaching and adsorbed pollutants) • Chemical and biological recycling of waste plastics and microplastics • Removal and remediation of microplastics via different methods • Modelling fate and transport of plastics and micro- and nanoplastics in the environment • Removal of nano and microplastics during wastewater and drinking water treatment • Nano and microplastics as a systemic risk for social-ecological supply systems • Valorisation of plastics waste into chemicals and/or fuels • Environmental economics and policy regarding plastic debris • Application of machine learning • Legislation, policies and economic impacts The author need to submit paper for review before the due submission deadline.
