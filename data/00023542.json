{"name":"9th International Conference on Smart Cities and Green ICT Systems - SMARTGREENS 2020","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.smartgreens.org","content":"The purpose of the 9th International Conference on Smart Cities and Green ICT Systems (SMARTGREENS) is to bring together researchers, designers, developers and practitioners interested in the advances and applications in the field of Smart Cities, Green Information and Communication Technologies, Sustainability, Energy Aware Systems and Technologies. \n Green Computing is nowadays one of the major challenges for most IT organizations that involve medium and large scale distributed infrastructures like Grids, Clouds and Clusters. The conference will focus on solutions for all aspects of green computing such as energy efficiency, carbon footprint reduction and cooling management. The tradeoffs between energy efficiency and performance have become key challenges that must be addressed in both, distributed and traditional performance-oriented infrastructures. Particularly relevant is the so-called Smart Grid technology, seeking to optimize distributed electricity generation, especially from renewable sources, and to promote the use of smart devices (including smart home and new vehicular energy approaches) that require further research on distributed communications, energy storage and integrations of various sources of energy. \n Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques and general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Papers describing original work are invited in any of the areas listed below. Accepted papers, presented at the conference by one of the authors, will be published in the Proceedings of SMARTGREENS. Acceptance will be based on quality, relevance and originality. Both full research reports and work-in-progress reports are welcome. There will be both oral and poster sessions. \n Special sessions, dedicated to case-studies and commercial presentations, as well as tutorials dedicated to technical/scientific topics are also envisaged: companies interested in presenting their products/methodologies or researchers interested in holding a tutorial, workshop or special session are invited to contact the conference secretariat or visit the SMARTGREENS conference website. \n Conference Topics: \n Area 1: Smart Cities \n \\- Case Studies, Business Models and Innovative Applications for Smart(Er) Cities \n \\- Safety, Security, and Privacy for Smart Cities \n \\- Human Smart Cities \n \\- Smart City Service Catalogues \n \\- User-Centred and Participatory Design of Services and Systems for Smart Cities \n \\- Service Innovation and Design to Support Smart Cities \n \\- Smart Sensor-Based Networks and Applications \n \\- Big Data and Urban Data Analytics \n \\- IS Architecture Designs and Platforms for Smart Cities \n \\- Case Studies and Innovative Applications for Smart(Er) Cities \n \\- Planning and Design Challenges for Smart Cities \n \\- Frameworks and Models for Smart City Initiatives \n Area 2: Smart Infrastructures and Smart Buildings \n \\- Intelligent Transport Systems and Traffic Management \n \\- eMobility and Smart Transport \n \\- Intelligent Buildings \n \\- Smart Sensor Networks \n \\- Integration Approaches and Interoperability Standards \n \\- Data Governance Approaches and Standards \n \\- Urban Monitoring and Optimization \n \\- Case Studies and Innovative Applications for Smart Infrastructures \n \\- Planning and Design Challenges for Smart Infrastructures \n \\- Innovation Labs, Experimental Test-Beds and Simulation Environments \n \\- Mechanisms for Motivating Behaviour Change \n \\- Internet-Enabled Infrastructures and Services \n Area 3: Smart and Digital Services \n \\- Mobility Services \n \\- Socio-Technical Integration and Stakeholder Involvement \n \\- Research and Innovation in Creative Industries \n \\- Digital Entrepreneurship \n \\- Service Architectures \n \\- Digital Social Networks \n \\- Digital Service Innovation \n \\- Digital Transformation for Public Sectors \n \\- Data Services \n \\- Service Adoption and Technology Transfer \n \\- Service Design \n \\- Digitalized Manufacturing Systems \n \\- Living-Labs & Open-Innovation \n \\- Design-Enabled Innovation in Cities \n \\- Simulation of Business Models and Architectures \n Area 4: Energy-Aware Systems and Technologies \n \\- Architectures for Smart Grids \n \\- Economic Models of Energy Efficiency \n \\- Energy Monitoring \n \\- Renewable Energy Resources \n \\- Greener Systems Planning and Design \n \\- Power Consumption \n \\- Evolutionary Algorithms in Energy Applications \n \\- Energy-Aware Process Optimisation \n \\- Optimization Techniques for Efficient Energy Consumption \n \\- Smart Energy Storage \n \\- Load Balancing in Smart Grids \n \\- Energy Management Systems (EMS) \n \\- Power Systems Engineering \n \\- Power System Modeling and Simulation \n \\- Power Grids \n Area 5: Sustainable Computing and Systems \n \\- Wireless Systems and Networks \n \\- Green Computing Models, Methodologies and Paradigms \n \\- Wearable Computing \n \\- Green Data Centers \n \\- Algorithms for Reduced Power, Energy and Heat \n \\- Green Communications Architectures and Frameworks \n \\- Qos and Green Computing \n \\- Integration of Smart Appliances \n \\- Smart Homes (Domotics) \n \\- Case Studies on Green Computing and Communications \n \\- Interoperability \n \\- Energy Efficient Network Hardware \n \\- Energy-Efficient Communication Protocols \n \\- Internet of Things \n \\- Green Software Engineering Methodologies and Tools \n \\- Security and Privacy ","date_start":"2020-05-02","date_end":"2020-05-04","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2019-12-13","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Business","Marketing/Social-Networking"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Prague","Czech Republic"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Prague","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Czech Republic"},"organizers":["INSTICC"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
