{"name":"Scale-up: What goes wrong? Virtual Training","series":"","short":"","website":"https://go.evvnt.com/616347-3?pid=4868","content":"This short course will look at the reasons why reactions don't always scale-up as expected, using real-life examples from industry. Some theory on mixing and related topics (such as heat transfer) will be covered along with useful tips on which types of reactions are likely to cause problems. The use of simple laboratory scale experiments to anticipate scale-up problems will be included. Case studies will be used to show how companies have avoided or corrected scale-up problems. When you register you will be sent links to join the on-line sessions. These will take place at the following time each day: Who should attend this on line course: Process development chemists and chemical engineers Discovery chemists who would like a window in to the world or process development Anyone involved in scaling up chemical processes. 2.30 - 4.00 pm | UK 3.30 - 5.00 | Central Europe 09.30 - 11.00 | Eastern US 6.30 - 8.00 am | West Coast US URL: Booking: https://go.evvnt.com/616347-0?pid=4868 Price: Course Fee: GBP 95.0 Speaker: Dr Will Watson Time: 09:00 - 17:00","date_start":"2020-06-16","date_end":"2020-06-17","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Medicine & Health","Public-Health","Public Health"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Virtual Event","Czech Republic"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Virtual Event","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Czech Republic"},"organizers":["Scientific Update Ltd"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
