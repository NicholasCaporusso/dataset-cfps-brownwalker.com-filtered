Let's meet in the \"City of the Kings\", a privileged place with a culture that is born from a mixture of other cultures where you can visit many tourist places such as cathedrals, squares, and museums that are witnesses of a majestic past and enjoy a gastronomy that seduces the world. Peru is preparing to make you feel safe, cared for, and protected. We have learned ever since the start of the pandemic, to turn distance into art, applying the utmost care for details because we know that all the effort is worth it. We have learned to build bridges to feel closer by joining our paths no matter how far we are so that you can take a break and enjoy one of the largest Veterinary Medicine Congresses in the world, which will bring together the best professionals from many veterinary specialities from around the globe, an event that you cannot miss! Get ready to visit this ancient, ancestral, cultural and touristic land where you can enjoy the immensity of the Pacific Ocean, the majesty of the mountains to the exuberant Amazon jungle. Enjoy a rich mix of cultures and visit scenarios such as the deepest canyons on earth, the largest river in the world, ancient cultures, and the oldest civilization in America; Macchu Picchu and other wonders that amaze all its visitors. For the local Organizing Committee, it will be a pleasure to receive you and to form bonds of friendship that will last forever!
