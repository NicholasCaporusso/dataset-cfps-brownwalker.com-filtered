The main theme of the conference is “Latest discoveries and computing to advanced imaging technologies in Photonics”. Meetings International is a global leader in producing high quality conferences meetings, workshops and symposia in all major fields of science, technology and medicine. Photonics 2020 which is designed to provide a platform for best discussion and networking as well as explore the new advancements related to the application of Lasers, Optics & Photonics technology to various fields related to industries. The Meeting will yield a look on new techniques in Engineering. Photonics is a part of study that involves the employment of energy such as light, whose basic component is that the gauge boson. Photonic applications use the gauge boson within the same method that negatronic applications use the electron. Devices that run on light-weight have variety of benefits over people who use electricity.","date_start":"2020-11-25","date_end":"2020-11-26","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2020-05-06","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Business","Marketing/Social-Networking"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["singapore","Singapore"],"name":"","street":"","city":"singapore","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Singapore"},"organizers":["meetings international"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
