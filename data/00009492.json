The global climate change affects crucial growth regulating environmental factors such as temperature, CO2 concentration and water availability. Within the context of global climate change, Plant Molecular Physiology plays an important role in agriculture and food production as a whole, focusing investigations on molecular, genetic and physiological basis of plant growth and how plants’ physiology is affected by stressful environment. The International Conference “Plant Molecular Physiology” to be held on February 23-24, 2017 in Vienna, Austria will discuss advances in Plant Molecular Physiology research, importance of plant molecular physiology in agriculture, interaction of different metabolic and molecular processes in plant cells, molecular growth of plants, the role of photosynthesis in ability of plant to cope with stressful changes in natural environment, molecular basis of stress tolerance of different species and other topics.","date_start":"2017-02-23","date_end":"2017-02-24","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2016-10-15","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Life Sciences","Plant-Biology","Plant science, biology and genetics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Vienna","Austria"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Vienna","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Austria"},"organizers":["Vienna International Science Conferences & Events Association (VISCEA)"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
