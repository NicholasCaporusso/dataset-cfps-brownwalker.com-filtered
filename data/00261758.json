E-learning or digital learning has become a necessity in the last two years and has set a benchmark for a certain standard in the field of education which must be continuously upheld. We also look for faster and more versatile methods of information exchange, and cross-culture teaching and learning. At the 8th International Conference on Research in Teaching and Education, we will tackle all this and more. In previous years, we welcomed participants from various countries: South Africa, New Zealand, Greece, Canada, Poland, Peru, Kenya, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and many others. We strive to make this education conference even bigger and better.","date_start":"2024-03-01","date_end":"2024-03-03","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2024-02-09","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Education / Legal / Other","Education","Teaching","Deep Learning"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Vienna","Austria"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Vienna","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Austria"},"organizers":["Acavent"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
