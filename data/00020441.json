{"name":"The 17th IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics","series":"","short":"","website":"www.isi-conf.org","content":"Call for Papers & Submissions The 17th IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI), Shenzhen, China July 1-3, 2019 Website: www.isi-conf.org Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI) research is an interdisciplinary research field involving academic researchers in information technologies, computer science, public policy, bioinformatics, medical informatics, and social and behavior studies as well as local, state, and federal law enforcement and intelligence experts, and information technology industry consultants and practitioners to support counterterrorism and homeland securityâ€™s missions of anticipation, interdiction, prevention, preparedness and response to terrorist acts. The annual IEEE International Conference on ISI (IEEE ISI) is a leading conference in security informatics domain, which was started in 2003 in Tucson, Arizona. Since then, the conference has been hosted in Atlanta, San Diego, New Brunswick, Taipei, Dallas, Vancouver, Beijing, Seattle, Washington DC, the Hague, Baltimore and Tucson. Over the past 16 years, the IEEE ISI Conference has evolved from its traditional orientation of intelligence and security domain towards a more integrated alignment of multiple domains, including technology, humans, organization, and security. The scientific community has increasingly recognized the need to address intelligence and security threats by understanding the interrelationships between these different components, and by integrating recent advances from different domains. This year, the IEEE ISI conference will be held in Shenzhen, China. ============================================================================== CONFERENCE THEME The conference theme is AI-Enabled Analytics. In addition to the main academic conference, multiple satellite events centered around the AI-enabled analytics theme will be organized as well. We invite academic researchers in the field of Intelligence and Security Informatics and related areas as well as law enforcement and intelligence experts, and industry consultants and practitioners in the field to submit papers and workshop proposals. ISI 2019 will be organized in four main tracks focusing on: I. Security Analytics and Threat Intelligence II. Data Science and Analytics in Security Informatics III. Human Behavior and Factors in the Security Applications IV. Organizational, National, and International Issues in Counter-terrorism and other Security Applications Submissions may include systems, methodology, test-bed, modeling, evaluation, and policy papers. Research should be relevant to informatics, organization, public policy, or human behavior in applications of counter-terrorism or protection of local/ national/ international security in the physical world and/or cyberspace. See specific topic suggestions below. =============================================================================== CONFERENCE TOPICS Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: I.
