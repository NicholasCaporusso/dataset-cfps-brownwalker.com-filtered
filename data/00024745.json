{"name":"Medicinal Chemistry","series":"","short":"","website":"https://go.evvnt.com/616365-2?pid=4868","content":"Medicinal chemists need to understand the relationship between chemical structure and the physical properties of molecules and how this translates into compound stability and the interaction of the molecule with biological structures. These biological targets include proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and cell membranes. Interaction of the molecules with these targets affects the distribution of the compound in biological systems and modulates biological function. To do this successfully the medicinal chemist needs to be aware of how target selection is carried out and how this effects lead generation. The medicinal chemist needs knowledge of structure property relationships, the physico-chemical properties of drugs and how these molecules interact with the body- pharmacokinetics and ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion). The course also includes an overview of the use of computational chemistry in virtual screening and library design. The lectures are backed up by a number of case studies and tutorial sessions, which involve the participants in using the concepts discussed.
