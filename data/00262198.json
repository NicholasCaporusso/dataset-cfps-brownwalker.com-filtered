Based on the overwhelmingly positive feedback of the attendees last year, we are excited to once again bring together members of the academia, scholars, researchers, non-profit, government, and business representatives for three days of vibrant discussions, fascinating presentations, and insightful workshops. ICRHS is more than a regular event. It’s a buzzing community, an opportunity to get published, a network of diverse minds, and so much more. Immerse yourself in the free exchange of ideas as you learn about the latest trends and discuss common challenges. And, following the tradition of the first event, we are inviting all attendees for a free tour of magnificent Cambridge.","date_start":"2024-12-12","date_end":"2024-12-14","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2024-11-22","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Social Sciences","Sociology","Anthropology","Humanities"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Cambridge","United Kingdom"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Cambridge","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"United Kingdom"},"organizers":["ACAVENT"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
