{"name":"Successful Nuclear Energy Project Development: Planning, financing and building nuclear power plants!","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.stratcoms.com/SNEPD2017","content":"Focusing on real-world planning, financing, business and economic issues, the course will examine how reactor procurements are actually undertaken and discuss the industry terminology used, key business issues, business models and global reactor vendor offers, as well as the major consulting, equipment supply, equipment qualification and service groupings that a developer might purchase during a typical nuclear power plant construction project. The course will explain different options for how spent fuel and radioactive waste can be successfully managed and commercial pricing and disposal strategies. The course will draw upon a wide range of international case study examples from Britain, China, Japan, Europe, the Middle East and the United States including the new Contracts for Difference (CfD) and Strike Price electricity market mechanisms that have been successfully applied in the UK to fund commercial nuclear build projects for the first time in liberalised private sector energy markets.","date_start":"2017-04-10","date_end":"2017-04-12","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Renewable Energy/Nuclear","nuclear energy"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Jakarta","Indonesia"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Jakarta","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Indonesia"},"organizers":[""],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
