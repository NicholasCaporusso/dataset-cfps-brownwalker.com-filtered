Orphan Drugs 2023 is scheduled in Hybrid Event: You can participate as In-Person or Virtually from your home or workplace. The conference will maintain its unique theme “Orphan drugs: Ray of hope for rare disease”. A rare disease is described by the World Health Organization as a disease or disorder that affects one in every 1000 people. However, rare diseases are not so rare these days. These diseases have grabbed the attention of the pharmaceutical industry and scientists over the past three decades. Orphan drugs are medications or vaccines that are used to treat, prevent, or diagnose a rare disorder (such as Huntington's disease, Tourette syndrome or myoclonus). These drugs are called orphan because of their rarity, without government funding it would be unprofitable to manufacture these drugs. Orphan drug production for rare diseases is rife with opportunities and obstacles on a global scale, including regulatory strategies, research and development, clinical trials, time to reach market, and affordability and accessibility disparities. It is timely that experts from academia and industry unite and address these issues that will steer the development of orphan drugs.","date_start":"2023-08-21","date_end":"2023-08-23","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2023-07-30","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Medicine & Health","Public-Health"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["United Kingdom"],"name":"","street":"","city":"","state":"","ZIP":"","country":""},"organizers":[""],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
