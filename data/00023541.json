{"name":"5th International Conference on Internet of Things, Big Data and Security - IoTBDS 2020","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.iotbds.org","content":"The internet of things (IoT) is a platform that allows a network of devices (sensors, smart meters, etc.) to communicate, analyse data and process information collaboratively in the service of individuals or organisations. The IoT network can generate large amounts of data in a variety of formats and using different protocols which can be stored and processed in the cloud. The conference looks to address the issues surrounding IoT devices, their interconnectedness and services they may offer, including efficient, effective and secure analysis of the data IoT produces using machine learning and other advanced techniques, models and tools, and issues of security, privacy and trust that will emerge as IoT technologies mature and become part of our everyday lives. \n Big Data (BD) has core values of volume, velocity, variety and veracity. After collecting much data from IoT, BD can be jointly used with machine learning, AI, statistical and other advanced techniques, models and methods, which can create values for people and organizations adopting it, since forecasting, deep analysis and analytics can help identify weaknesses and make improvements based on different analysis. \n Maintaining a high level of security and privacy for data in IoT are crucial and we welcome recommendations, solutions, demonstrations and best practices for all forms of security and privacy for IoT and BD. \n Conference Topics: \n Area 1: Big Data Research \n \\- Big Data Fundamentals: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity and Value \n \\- Modeling, Experiments, Sharing Technologies & Platforms \n \\- Analytics, Intelligence and Knowledge Engineering \n \\- Data Center Enabled Technologies \n \\- Networking and Social Networks \n \\- Data Management for Large Data \n \\- Software Frameworks (MapReduce, Spark Etc) and Simulations \n \\- Social Science and Implications for Big Data \n Area 2: Emerging Services and Analytics \n \\- Health Informatics as a Service (HIaaS) for Any Type of Health Informatics, Computation and Services \n \\- Big Data as a Service (BDaaS) including Frameworks, Empirical Approaches and Data Processing Techniques \n \\- Big Data Algorithm, Methodology, Business Models and Challenges \n \\- Security as a Service including Any Algorithms, Methodology and Software Proof-of-Concepts \n \\- Financial Software as a Service (FSaaS) including Risk and Pricing Analysis; Predictive Modeling \n \\- Education as a Service (EaaS) including eLearning and Educational Applications \n \\- Business Process as a Service (BPaaS) including Workflows and Supply Chain in IoT and Big Data \n \\- Analytics as a Service (AaaS) for Any Types of Analytics \n \\- Scheduling, Service Duplication, Fairness, Load Balance for SaaS and Analytics \n \\- eGovernment, eCommerce, eScience and Creative Technologies for IoT and Big Data \n \\- IoT Services and Applications \n \\- New Service Models and Emerging Services \n Area 3: Internet of Things (IoT) Fundamentals \n \\- Software Architecture and Middleware \n \\- Context-Awareness and Location-Awareness \n \\- Performance Evaluation and Modeling \n \\- Networking and Communication Protocols \n \\- Machine to Machine Communications \n \\- Energy Efficiency \n \\- Software Engineering for IoT and IoE \n \\- Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches Data Analytics \n Area 4: Internet of Things (IoT) Applications \n \\- Technological Focus for Smart Environments \n \\- Smart City Examples and Case Studies \n \\- Architecture for Secure and Interactive IoT \n \\- Intelligent Infrastructure and Guidance Systems for Vehicles, Green Systems and Smart City \n \\- Sensor Networks, Remote Diagnosis and Development \n \\- Transportation Management Traffic Theory, Modeling and Simulation \n \\- Social Implications for IoT Intelligent \n \\- Systems for IoT and Services Computing \n Area 5: Big Data for Multi-discipline Services \n \\- Smart City and Transportation \n \\- Education and Learning \n \\- Business, Finance and Management \n \\- Social Networks Analysis, Media and eGovernment \n \\- Risk Modeling, Simulation, Legal Challenges \n \\- Case Studies of Real Adoption \n \\- Biomedical Experiments and Simulations \n \\- Healthcare Services and Health Informatics \n Area 6: Security, Privacy and Trust \n \\- Algorithms, Software Engineering and Development \n \\- Testing (Software Engineering; Penetration; Product Development) \n \\- Encryption (All Aspects) \n \\- Firewall, Access Control, Identity Management \n \\- Experiments on Using Security Solutions and Proof-of-Concepts \n \\- Intrusion and Detection Techniques \n \\- Social Engineering and Ethical Hacking: Techniques and Case Studies \n \\- Software Engineering for Security Modeling, Business Process Modeling and Analytics \n \\- Location-Based Privacy \n \\- Data Security, Data Recovery, Disaster Recovery \n \\- Adoption Challenges and Recommendation \n \\- Emerging Issues and Recommendations for Organizational Security \n \\- Case Studies \n \\- Security, Privacy and Trust \n Area 7: IoT Technologies \n \\- 3D Printing \n \\- Artificial Intelligence \n \\- Biotechnology \n \\- Communication \n \\- Data Processing \n \\- Electronic Technologies for in-Vehicle \n \\- Internet of Things \n \\- Mode-to-Mode Systems \n \\- Nanotechnology \n \\- Sensors \n \\- Transport Safety and Mobility \n \\- Vehicle-to-Infrastructure \n \\- Vehicle-to-Vehicle ","date_start":"2020-05-07","date_end":"2020-05-09","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2019-12-13","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Business","Marketing/Social-Networking"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Prague","Czech Republic"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Prague","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Czech Republic"},"organizers":["INSTICC"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
