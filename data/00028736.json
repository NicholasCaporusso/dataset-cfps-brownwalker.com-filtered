{"name":"4th International Conference on Inventive Research in Material Science and Technology","series":"","short":"","website":"https://iroglobal.com/ICIRMCT2019/2022","content":"In this digital electronics, electronic materials are occupying an integral part on all electronic and electro-mechanical devices. Since, the performance any electronic applications are directly dependent on the materials used, the invention of advanced materials are becoming as the backbone of any electronic applications in order to upgrade its functionality as well as the capacity. The research and development on material science will remain as the starting point for future advances in electronics. Henceforth, this 4th International Conference on Inventive Research in Material Science and Technology \\[ICIRMCT 2022\\] aims to report the science and technology of electronic materials. Also, ICIRMCT 2022 intends to examine and showcase the new applications of semiconductors, optical and display materials, metallic and magnetic alloys and so on. Also, we welcome the research articles that report state-of-the-art methods for fabricating advanced materials and evaluate the physical, chemical, optical, and electronic properties.","date_start":"2022-07-15","date_end":"2022-07-16","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2022-07-06","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Electrical/ Electronic","Electrical & Electronic Engineering"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Online Event","India"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Online Event","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"India"},"organizers":["Inventive Research Organization [IRO]"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
