{"name":"10th International Conference on Social Science, Humanities and Education","series":"","short":"","website":"https://www.icshe.org","content":"Following the success of the 9th edition of the event, we are proud to announce that the International Conference on Social Sciences, Humanities and Education is returning for its 10th edition. ICSHE is a premier social sciences conference that brings together members of academia – scholars, researchers, graduate and post-graduate students, and scientists – from around the world for three days of immersive learning and networking. This is a unique opportunity to connect with your peers from dozens of countries and learn from their unique perspectives and experience. ICSHE is not like most social sciences conferences. We strive to build a true community of academics. That’s why we see the event as a part of the larger knowledge platform – one based on the principles of collaboration, transparency, and open-access learning. While the event itself is only three days, the community that you will become a part of will inspire you for years. If you can’t join us in the vibrant city of London, United Kingdom, make sure to apply for virtual participation. Among all the social science conferences of 2024, ICSHE is the one you don’t want to miss out on!","date_start":"2024-11-22","date_end":"2024-11-24","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2024-11-01","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Arts & Humanities","Philosophy"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["London","United Kingdom"],"name":"","street":"","city":"London","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"United Kingdom"},"organizers":["Acavent"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
