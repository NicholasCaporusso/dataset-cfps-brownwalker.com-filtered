{"name":"10th International Conference on Pervasive and Parallel Computing, Communication and Sensors - PECCS 2020 [Online Streaming]","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.peccs.org","content":"Pervasive and parallel computing and communication aim at providing effective computing solutions and communication services. Sensors and intelligent data processing are the counterpart of current semi-autonomous systems. With the advent of Industry 4.0 and IoT this interdisciplinary field brings together R&D and real-world applications, using intelligent data analysis, signal processing and software technologies, over pervasive, wireless, wearable and/or mobile systems. Applications range from ambient intelligence, to industrial automation, from ubiquitous multimedia to multidimensional signal processing, from robotics to integrated systems and nanotechnologies.","date_start":"2020-11-03","date_end":"2020-11-05","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2020-07-24","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Online Event","Portugal"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Online Event","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Portugal"},"organizers":["INSTICC"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
