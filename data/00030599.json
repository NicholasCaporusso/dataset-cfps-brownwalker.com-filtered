In addition, attendees will gain knowledge that will assist them in dealing with their own death. Peter Koestenbaum has written that \"Death reveals us to ourselves as individuals and as finite.\" In general, the more one accepts and understands their own death, the better they will be able to be compassionate when assisting others who are facing the end of life. This class will engage the learner in applying concepts to their own lives as well as learning how to help others.
