{"name":"International Conference: Memory and the Unconscious","series":"","short":"","website":"https://memory.lcir.co.uk/memory-unconscious","content":"Does the body remember what the mind tries to forget? The psychoanalytic tradition grew out of Sigmund Freud's interest in hysteria, and the body's capacity to record painful events in the guise of psychosomatic symptoms. The painful narrative that becomes 'unspeakable' gains potency as it roams around the body, possessing various parts of us. Instead of a wandering womb (originally believed to be the cause of hysteria), it is the banished signifier that wanders, seeking expression. The conference sessions will be scheduled on Saturday, 11 December 2021 and we invite proposals for paper and poster presentations addressing the conference theme. The proposals should be sent to memory@lcir.co.uk by 10 November 2021\\.
