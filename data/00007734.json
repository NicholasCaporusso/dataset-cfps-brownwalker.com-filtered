Neurotechnology shows a very high potential of enhancing human activities, involving technologies such as neural rehabilitation, neural prosthesis, neuromodulation, neurosensing and diagnosis, and other combinations of neurological and biomedical knowledge with engineering technologies. NEUROTECHNIX 2016 will be held in conjunction with icSPORTS 2016\\. CONGRESS AREAS Each of these topic areas is expanded below but the sub-topics list is not exhaustive.
