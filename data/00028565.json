The growth of the World- Wide Web today is simply phenomenal. It continues to grow rapidly and new technologies, applications are being developed to support end users modern life. Semantic Technologies are designed to extend the capabilities of information on the Web and enterprise databases to be networked in meaningful ways. Semantic web is emerging as a core discipline in the field of Computer Science & Engineering from distributed computing, web engineering, databases, social networks, Multimedia, information systems, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, soft computing, and human-computer interaction. The adoption of standards like XML, Resource Description Framework and Web Ontology Language serve as foundation technologies to advancing the adoption of semantic technologies. Topics considered include but are not limited to: Authors are solicited to contribute to the conference by submitting articles that illustrate research results, projects, surveying works and industrial experiences that describe significant advances in the following areas, but are not limited to • Semantic Query & Search • Semantic Advertising and Marketing • Linked Data, Taxonomies • Collaboration and Social Networks • Semantic Web and Web 2.0/AJAX, Web 3.0 • Semantic Case Studies • Ontologies (Creation, Merging, Linking and Reconciliation) • Semantic Integration Rules • Data Integration and Mashups • Unstructured Information • Developing Semantic Applications • Semantics for Enterprise Information Management (EIM) • Knowledge Engineering and Management • Semantic SOA (Service Oriented Architectures) • Database Technologies for the Semantic Web • Semantic Web for E-Business, Governance and E-Learning • Semantic Brokering, Semantic Interoperability, Semantic Web Mining • Semantic Web Services (Service Description, Discovery, Invocation, Composition) • Semantic Web Inference Schemes • Information Discovery and Retrieval in Semantic Web • Information Discovery and Retrieval in Semantic Web • Web Services Foundation, Architectures and Frameworks • Web Languages & Web Service Applications • Web Services-Driven Business Process Management • Collaborative Systems Techniques • Communication, Multimedia Applications Using Web Services • Virtualization • Federated Identity Management Systems • Interoperability and Standards • Social and Legal Aspect of Internet Computing • Internet and Web-based Applications and Services Paper Submission Authors are invited to submit papers for this journal through Email: ijwest@aircconline.com or through Submission System.
