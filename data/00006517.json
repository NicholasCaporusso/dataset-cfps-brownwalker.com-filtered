{"name":"The International Conference on Internet of Things and Big Data – IoTBD 2016","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.iotbd.org","content":"Internet of Things (IoT) is a platform and a phenomenon that allows everything to process information, communicate data, analyze context collaboratively and in the service or individuals, organizations and businesses. In the process of doing so, a large amount of data with different formats and content has to be processed efficiently, quickly and intelligently through advanced algorithms, techniques, models and tools. This new paradigm is enabled by the maturity of several different technologies, including the internet, wireless communication, cloud computing, sensors, big data analytics and machine learning algorithms. Conference Areas: Each of these topic areas is expanded below but the sub-topics list is not exhaustive. Papers may address one or more of the listed sub-topics, although authors should not feel limited by them.
