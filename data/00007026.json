PhyCS is the annual meeting of the physiological interaction and computing community, and serves as the main international forum for engineers, computer scientists and health professionals, interested in outstanding research and development that bridges the gap between physiological data handling and human-computer interaction. PhyCS 2016 will be held in conjunction with PECCS 2016 and ICETE 2016\\. Conference Areas: Each of these topic areas is expanded below but the sub-topics list is not exhaustive.
