{"name":"Let’s talk about ageing - International Conference on Ageing","series":"","short":"","website":"https://ageing.eventqualia.net","content":"The numbers speak for themselves: we are moving towards an ageing society with a strong representation in the highest age ranges. This needs to be addressed. The way we age is now a motive of reflection and concern among various scientific and professional fields. Whether it’s Medicine, Cosmetics, Sports, Leisure, Economics or Politics, there are no unaffected areas when we speak about structural implications of this natural phenomenon and it’s social outcomes. Talking about the richness and complexity of the contemporary ageing is the main goal of this conference. In two days of multidisciplinary programming, we’ll cross perspectives from several fields. From Geriatrics to Sociology, Law, Psychology, Sports, Nutritions, Religions, among many others, believing that the articulation of their contributes and experiences may enhance the knowledge about a cross and timeless interest. Based on some relevant and current discussion topics, Let’s Talk About Ageing is Multidisciplinary Scientific Congress and also an informal meeting to cross scientific and professional knowledge with daily experiences, and will certainly be an enriching moment for researchers, professionals and everyone interested in this area. Conference Proceedings & Abstract Book will be published after the congress.","date_start":"2018-10-15","date_end":"2018-10-16","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2018-09-10","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Medicine & Health","Other","Healthcare"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Porto","Portugal"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Porto","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Portugal"},"organizers":["eventQualia"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
