{"name":"3rd International Conference on Islamic Heritage Architecture and Art","series":"","short":"","website":"https://www.wessex.ac.uk/conferences/2020/islamic-heritage-2020","content":"The conference aims to highlight the importance of Islamic heritage architecture and art to the world and its influence across different regions. The meeting will deal with the design of many types of buildings in Islamic countries, including not only the better known public buildings like mosques, mausolea, citadels and forts, but also houses and gardens, engineering works such as bridges and dams, irrigation systems and many others which have also had a profound impact on society. Islamic architecture has enriched design with a wide variety of structural shapes, including among others, unique arches, a wide variety of vaults and domes which allow for new forms to be developed. The influence that these structural forms have in non-Islamic countries will be one of the themes of the conference.","date_start":"2020-06-09","date_end":"2020-06-11","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2020-06-08","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Architectural/Environmental","Islamic Studies"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Online Event",""],"name":"","street":"","city":"Online Event","state":"","ZIP":"","country":""},"organizers":["Wessex Institute"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
