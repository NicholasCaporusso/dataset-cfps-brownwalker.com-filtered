{"name":"Barriers and Enablers to Learning Maths and Stats conference 2018","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/engineering/research/divisions/biomedical/seminars/belm2018","content":"The conference examines learning and teaching throughout the life span, from the most basic to the most advanced topics and for the full range of learners, including people with dyscalculia and other maths learning difficulties, gifted learners, mathematicians and 'traditional' learners. This should lead to cross-fertilisation between different areas of learning and teaching. The conference is also highly interdisciplinary. In addition to mathematicians, it should be of interest amongst others to psychologists, teachers, pedagogical and educational experts, engineers, scientists and social scientists. The conference is intended for all sectors of education and school based teachers and specialists are most welcome both to attend and participate either on one of the themed days or for the three day duration.","date_start":"2018-06-04","date_end":"2018-06-06","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2017-11-27","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Physical Science & Math","Mathematics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Glasgow","United Kingdom"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Glasgow","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"United Kingdom"},"organizers":[""],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
