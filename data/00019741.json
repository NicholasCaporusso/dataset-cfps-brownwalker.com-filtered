{"name":"The Impacts of Civic Technology Conference (TICTeC 2019)","series":"","short":"","website":"https://tictec.mysociety.org/2019","content":"Returning for a fifth year, TICTeC 2019 will focus on the impact that civic technology and digital democracy are having upon citizens, decision makers and governments around the world. Primarily, the goal of TICTeC is to promote and share rigorous and meaningful research into online technologies and digital democracy around the world. The conference facilitates discussion and networking amongst individuals and groups to find real-world solutions through sharing evidence of impact, and (importantly) evidence of what doesnâ€™t work. In association with the OECD, TICTeC 2019 will bring together individuals from academic and applied backgrounds as well as businesses, public authorities, NGOs, funders and education institutions to discuss ideas, present research and build a network of individuals interested in the civic technology landscape.","date_start":"2019-03-19","date_end":"2019-03-20","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2019-01-11","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Paris","France"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Paris","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"France"},"organizers":["mySociety"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
