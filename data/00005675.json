{"name":"Strong Voices Conference","series":"","short":"","website":"http://strongvoices.eventbrite.com/?aff=BrownWalker","content":"Strong Voices is a two-year project, funded by the Department for Education (DfE) to find ways of enabling disadvantaged and vulnerable young people to access arts and culture. Most people now recognise that participation in arts and culture has important benefits to offer disadvantaged and vulnerable young people in particular. Strong Voices is the latest contribution to a rich history of this work, and importantly is taking place right now in a unique, interesting and sometimes challenging climate. We have learned huge amounts through this action research project, and we certainly don’t have all the answers! We would like to share what we’ve discovered with you, and invite you to join the debate by contributing your own learning, ideas and opinions too. We hope this conference will help us all to continue raising the quality and effectiveness of what we offer to those young people who need it most.","date_start":"2015-03-06","date_end":"","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Education / Legal / Other","Regional-Cultural","Art & art history"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Newcastle","United Kingdom"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Newcastle","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"United Kingdom"},"organizers":["Curious Minds"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
