{"name":"Quantum Technology International Conference â€“ QTech 2024","series":"","short":"","website":"https://premc.org/conferences/qtech-quantum-technology","content":"The growing ability to manipulate quantum systems is paving the way for a second quantum revolution and several initiatives worldwide have been formed to foster quantum technologies. These exciting novel applications exploit specific quantum properties that are not accessible with classical resources such as superposition and entanglement of individual quantum systems. The objectives of the QTech conference, which will take place on September 10-12, 2024 in Berlin, is to present the latest developments of quantum technologies in the domains of quantum communication, computation, simulation, sensors and metrology, both in their implementation using various platforms from atoms and ions to solid states, superconducting circuits and optics, as well as in their conceptual and theoretical foundations.","date_start":"2024-09-10","date_end":"2024-09-12","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2024-06-14","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Electrical/ Electronic","Optics And Laser Science","Quantum Computation"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Berlin","Berlin Germany"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Berlin","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Berlin Germany"},"organizers":["Entropy MDPI"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
