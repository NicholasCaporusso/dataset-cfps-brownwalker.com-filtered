Effective knowledge management is an increasingly important source of competitive advantage, and a key to the success of contemporary organizations, bolstering the collective expertise of its employees and partners. Information Sharing (IS) is a term used for a long time in the information technology (IT) lexicon, related to data exchange, communication protocols and technological infrastructures. Although standardization is indeed an essential element for sharing information, IS effectiveness requires going beyond the syntactic nature of IT and delve into the human functions involved in the semantic, pragmatic and social levels of organizational semiotics. The two areas are intertwined as information sharing is the foundation for knowledge management. KMIS is part of IC3K, the 8th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management. IC3K 2016 will be held in conjunction with IJCCI 2016\\.
