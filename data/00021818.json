{"name":"9th International Conference on Pervasive and Embedded Computing and Communication Systems - PECCS 2019","series":"","short":"","website":" http://www.peccs.org/ ","content":"Pervasive and embedded computing and communication is a paradigm that aims at providing trustworthy computing solutions and communication services all the time and everywhere. This entails the need for an interdisciplinary field of R&D that combines signal processing with computer hardware and software technologies, and utilizes and integrates pervasive, wireless, embedded, wearable and/or mobile systems. Applications range from ambient intelligence to ubiquitous multimedia, multidimensional signal processing, sensors, robotics, integrated communication systems and nanotechnologies. PECCS will bring together researchers, engineers and practitioners interested in the theory and applications in these areas. \n Conference Topics: \n Area 1: Wireless and Mobile Technologies \n \\- Next Generation Mobile Networks \n \\- MIMO Systems and Techniques \n \\- Performance Analysis of Wireless Networks \n Area 2: Sensor Networks: Software, Architectures and Applications \n \\- Localization and Positioning Schemes \n \\- Modeling, Algorithms, and Performance Evaluation \n Area 3: Intelligent Data Analysis and Processing \n \\- Aggregation, Classification and Tracking \n \\- Pattern Recognition \n \\- Statistical and Adaptive Signal Processing \n \\- Information Retrieval and Data Mining \n Area 4: Mobile Computing Systems and Services \n \\- Mobile Internet and Mobility Management \n \\- Wireless Sensors, Ad-Hoc and Mesh Networks \n Area 5: Multimedia Signal Processing \n \\- Multimedia Communication Systems \n \\- Time-Frequency Analysis \n \\- Wavelet Signal Processing ","date_start":"2019-09-19","date_end":"2019-09-20","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2019-07-12","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Vienna","Austria"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Vienna","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Austria"},"organizers":["INSTICC"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
