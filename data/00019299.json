{"name":"High Content Imaging 2019","series":"","short":"","website":"https://www.rms.org.uk/discover-engage/event-calendar/an-introduction-to-high-content-imaging.html","content":"High content imaging (HCI) involves automated collection and analysis of images to provide quantitative data on a range of functional and morphological changes in cells, spheroids or organoids. It has become widely used as a tool for, amongst other things, screening of drug candidates, fragments, RNAi and miR. This meeting is aimed at introducing the power of HCI to PhD students, early career researchers and academics who are new to HCI or would like to increase their understanding of the technique. It will cover experimental requirements, image collection techniques and analysis in high content imaging, as well as example applications for this approach. Major suppliers of HCI software and analysis will also demonstrate applications and uses of their software.","date_start":"2019-02-12","date_end":"","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Life Sciences","Other","Life Sciences (nature)"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Nottingham","United Kingdom"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Nottingham","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"United Kingdom"},"organizers":["Royal Microscopical Society"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
