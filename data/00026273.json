When conducting PMCF, the manufacturer should proactively collect and evaluate clinical data from the use in or on humans of a device which bears the CE marking and is placed on the market with the aim of confirming the safety and performance throughout the expected lifetime of the device, of ensuring the continued acceptability of identified risks and of detecting emerging risks on the basis of factual evidence. PMCF shall be performed pursuant to a documented method laid down in a PMCF plan.
