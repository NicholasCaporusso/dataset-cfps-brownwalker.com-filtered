{"name":"4th International Conference on Energy Production and Management: The Quest for Sustainable Energy","series":"","short":"","website":"https://www.wessex.ac.uk/conferences/2020/energy-production-and-management-2020","content":"The aim of the meeting is to discuss the future of energy production, operation and management in a changing world. The objective is to compare conventional energy sources, particularly hydrocarbons, with a number of other ways of producing energy, emphasising new technological developments, based on renewable resources such as solar, hydro, wind and geothermal. A key issue is the conversion of new sustainable sources of energy into useful forms (electricity, heat, fuel) while finding efficient ways of storage and distribution. In many cases, the challenges lie as much with the production of such renewable energy at an acceptable cost, including damage to the environment, as with the integration of those resources into the existing infrastructure.","date_start":"2020-06-16","date_end":"2020-06-18","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2020-06-15","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Renewable Energy/Nuclear","energy and sustainability"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Online Event",""],"name":"","street":"","city":"Online Event","state":"","ZIP":"","country":""},"organizers":["Wessex Institute"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
