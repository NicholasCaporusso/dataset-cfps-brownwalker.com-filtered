Tweet with us #AMAPublicPolicy Theme: Fostering Change for Communities and Society The Marketing & Public Policy Conference (MPPC) is the premier national and international event for marketing academics, public policy makers, and marketing practitioners interested in social and public policy. This year’s conference theme, Fostering Change for Communities and Society, highlights the ability of policy efforts to impart change at both the community and societal level in ways that impact the lives of consumers and the quality of our society. As such, our theme recognizes the many issues that call for greater research, debate, and action—from the local to the global level and all points in between. We welcome the submission of work addressing significant issues at the intersection of marketing and public policy. Research helping to understand or ignite change—such as through policy making, business practices, or collaborating with grass-roots community efforts—is especially encouraged.","date_start":"2016-06-23","date_end":"2016-06-25","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Business","Marketing/Social-Networking","Marketing & advertising"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["San Luis Obispo","CA","United States"],"name":"","street":"","city":"San Luis Obispo","state":"CA","ZIP":"","country":"United States"},"organizers":["American Marketing Association"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
