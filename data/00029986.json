The conference deliberations will be on the theme “Global View of Down-To-Earth Geological Advancements for Reaching Sustainable Goals.” The global summit aims to bring together researchers, scientists, academicians, geologists, earth science experts, industry professionals and engage people who are enthusiastic about geoscience and its role in solving global problems. This is accomplished through a diverse and entertaining program spanning across two-days having plenary talks, keynote forums, symposiums, panel discussions, oral and poster presentations that represent our main areas of focus. We hope to promote knowledge and awareness of the future of geology and earth science through our worldwide congress. Geology 2022 is an international high-level policy event that brings together leaders from all walks of life to discuss ideas and experiences. The conference's goal is to promote diversity, inclusivity, and professional ethics in all aspects of our Society in order to create an environment where geoscientists can thrive. We've compiled a list of exceptional sessions that will allow you to focus on certain topics based on your own perspective, interest and experiences.
