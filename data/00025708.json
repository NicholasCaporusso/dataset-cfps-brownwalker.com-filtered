IMPORTANT DATES: Regular Paper Submission: September 14, 2020 Authors Notification (regular papers): November 12, 2020 Final Regular Paper Submission and Registration: November 26, 2020 Position Paper Submission: October 29, 2020 Authors Notification (position papers): December 4, 2020 Final Regular Paper Submission and Registration: December 18, 2020 Scope: The International Conference on Computer Graphics Theory and Applications aims at becoming a major point of contact between researchers, engineers and practitioners in Computer Graphics. The conference will be structured along four main tracks, covering different aspects related to Computer Graphics, from Modelling to Rendering, including Animation, Interactive Environments and Social Agents in Computer Graphics. We welcome papers describing original work in any of the areas listed below. Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques as well as general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Paper acceptance will be based on quality, relevance to the conference themes and originality. The conference program will include both oral and poster presentations. Special sessions, dedicated to case-studies and commercial presentations, as well as technical tutorials, dedicated to technical/scientific topics, are also envisaged.
