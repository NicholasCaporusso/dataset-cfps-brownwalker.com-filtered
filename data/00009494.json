{"name":"The 4th International Conference “Plant Transformation & Biotechnology”","series":"","short":"","website":"http://viscea.org/index.php/plant-trans-biotech","content":"Plant Transformation is now a core research tool to fight against hunger, to open up the new avenues of science, to evolve the crop varieties, which are multipurpose, producing high harvests under normal and natural stressful conditions to make Earth green and prosperous. The major technical challenge facing plant transformation is the development of methods and constructs to produce a high proportion of plants showing predictable and precise transgene expression without collateral genetic damage. The 4th International Conference “Plant Transformation & Biotechnology” to be held on June 29-30, 2017 in Vienna, Austria will discuss current key objectives of the plant transformation technologies including understanding and control of precise transgene integration, expression and stability in plants, improved transformation systems, address biosafety considerations and develop GM crops for the benefit of developing countries.","date_start":"2017-06-29","date_end":"2017-06-30","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2017-04-01","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Life Sciences","Plant-Biology","Plant science, biology and genetics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Vienna","Austria"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Vienna","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Austria"},"organizers":["Vienna International Science Conferences & Events Association (VISCEA)"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
