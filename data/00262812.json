{"name":"World Conference on GOLD 2025","series":"","short":"","website":"https://premc.org/gold2025","content":"Following the success of the previous tri-annual GOLD conferences on the applications of gold in high-technology (Qu√©bec 2022; Paris 2018; Cardiff 2015), the GOLD 2025 conference (10 th ) will be held on May 11-14, 2025 in San Sebastian, Spain. The event will take place at the Kursaal Convention Center, a splendid venue by the seaside. Gold has generated commercial, technological and scientific interest for centuries and this interest is far from declining. All on the contrary, gold is an essential component of high-technology materials and the subject of intensive research in various fields. We aim at attracting experts in different fields, from catalysis, biomedicine, organometallics, nanoparticle synthesis and characterization, plasmonics, optics and photonics, electronics, as well as precious metals purification and recycling. Particular emphasis will be put in the chemistry and physics around much of the current technological interest, including catalysis, nanophotonics, and biomedical applications. At GOLD 2025, prominent specialists from these different topics will gather and lead the discussion of the most recent highlights and achievements within their fields. The conference will provide a comprehensive overview of the different areas of gold science and technology in a lively atmosphere and a unique environment.","date_start":"2025-05-11","date_end":"2025-05-14","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2024-11-15","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Material/Nanotechnology","Nanomaterials","Chemistry"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["San Sebastian","Basque Autonomous Community Spain"],"name":"","street":"","city":"San Sebastian","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Basque Autonomous Community Spain"},"organizers":["/"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
