Besides the educational aspect, that is revised each year, INCASO offers cultural immersion into the traditions of the Croatian Northern Adriatic region and participation into the biggest project by the Rijeka Tourist Board â€“ the Rijeka Carnival. The educational dimension of the INCASO program includes skills and knowledge students gain in the field of marketing and entrepreneurship. The emphasis is on teamwork, cultural experiences, and innovativeness. The cultural dimension of the program is in its close connection to one of the longest and most famous traditions of Rijeka and the surrounding area. The idea to form this student program has risen from the need to develop innovative interdisciplinary projects that connect an international audience with the local community. Additionally, this project gives an opportunity for international students to learn about, but also experience, the unique European cultural heritage that Croatia offers, and that is an integral part of Europe as a community, and hence belongs to all Europeans.","date_start":"2019-02-25","date_end":"2019-03-04","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Business","Marketing/Social-Networking"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Rijeka","Croatia"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Rijeka","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Croatia"},"organizers":["PAR University College"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
