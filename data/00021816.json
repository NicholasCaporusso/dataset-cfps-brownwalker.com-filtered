Lawrence Yao,Columbia University, USA Prof.Y. Lawrence Yao is Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Columbia University, where he directs the Advanced Manufacturing Laboratory. Yao served as Chair of Mechanical Engineering Department at Columbia University between 2005 and 2011\\. Yao has pioneered research in laser materials processing, including laser assisted removal, shaping, joining, and property modification of various materials, and innovative laser applications in renewable energy, biomedical, and art restoration fields. Yao is a Fellow of ASME, SME and Laser Institute of America and currently serves as Editor, Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering of ASME. 2.Prof. Andrew Rae,University of the Highlands and Islands, UK Prof Andrew Rae graduated from Imperial College in 1987 and joined the High-Lift Section of the Aerodynamics Department at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (later DRA, DERA and QinetiQ), Farnborough. He was Deputy Chairman of the Technical & Scientific Board of the European Wind Tunnel Association (EWA) and within this framework was the focus for wind tunnel correction and advanced simulation methodologies. He was a QinetiQ Approved Technical Authority and, as such, the signatory for the aerodynamics clearance of flight test aircraft modified to accommodate trials or upgrade equipment, and became a QinetiQ Technical Fellow in 2008 for his contribution to applied and experimental aerodynamics. 3.Prof. Yong Zhao,Nazarbayev University, Kazakhstan Dr. Michael Yong Zhao received his PhD and MSc from the University of Manchester, UK on a Sino-British Friendship Scholarship from the PRC/UK governments, and his BEng from Xi'an Jiaotong University, PRC. He has held faculty and admin positions at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore from 1992-2010 and Alfaisal University, KSA from 2010-2016\\. Since 2016 he is a professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the Nazabayev University in Kazakhstan. His research interests include computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and computational structural dynamics (CSD) and their engineering applications in biomedical engineering, combustion engines and renewable energy systems. 4.Prof. Huang Weimin,Nanyang Technological University, Singapore Dr Wei Min Huang is currently an Associate Professor (tenured) at the School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. With over 20 years of experience on various shape memory materials (alloy, polymer, composite and hybrid), he has published over 180 papers in journals, such as Materials Today, Accounts of Chemical Research and Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, and has been invited to review manuscripts from over 200 international journals (including Progress in Polymer Science, Nature Communications, Advanced Materials, and Advanced Functional Material, etc), project proposals from American Chemical Society, Hong Kong Research Grants Council, etc, and book proposals from Springer, CRC and Elsevier. ●Topics of interest for submission include, but are not limited to: Data science in mechanical Engineering Dynamic systems, measurement and control Energy resources technology Engineering materials and technology Manufacturing processes and systems Mechanical design Aerodynamics and Aeroelasticity Aerospace Guidance, Dynamics and Controls Aerospace Information Systems More topics can be found at: http://www.icmae.net/CFP.html ●Paper Submission 1\\.
