{"name":"9th International conference on Advanced Research in Education, Teaching and Learning","series":"","short":"","website":"https://aretl.org","content":"In recent years, we have seen a huge step forward in innovations and development in education, teaching, and learning. This was observed – and, to a large extent, forced by – the pandemic, when digital learning and technological tools were relied on heavily. However, this didn’t come without its own set of challenges and concerns: how to execute cross-border learning, improve information exchange, and, most importantly, how to avail these new trends and practices on local and international levels. At the 9th International Conference on Advanced Research in Education, Teaching, and Learning, we offer a global forum to discuss and debate about these problems and also discover effective solutions. With attendees and presenters from all over the world, we hailed great success in past conferences and hope to exceed all expectations with this year’s education conference. Discover the high quality of the program, which is the result of the dedication of the scientific committee to feature an agenda with topics that are not only relevant, but original, and meticulously researched. At this event, we’re bringing together an array of academics, scholars, researchers, and experts who will showcase the newest advancements in the fields of learning, teaching, and education. Furthermore, engage in immersive conversations with leading experts, get inspired to start or present your research, and maybe even get published in distinguished academic journals.","date_start":"2024-12-06","date_end":"2024-12-08","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2024-11-18","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Education / Legal / Other","Education","Education","Teaching"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Paris","France"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Paris","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"France"},"organizers":["Acavent"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
