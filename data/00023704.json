{"name":"Comp2Clinic Workshop: Biomedical Researchers & Clinicians Closing the Gap Between Translational Research and Healthcare Practice","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.biostec.org/C2C.aspx","content":"Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are a major component in healthcare across disease prediction, patient outcomes, image interpretation, and triaging capabilities. It is critical that clinicians become integral to the algorithmic development and clinical applications of this methodology. We are seeking papers that have identified clinical needs that can be addressed by AI and that can provide insight into successes and failures of bringing findings into the clinic. We hope to encourage conversation around how improved collaborations can enhance health care systems.","date_start":"2020-02-24","date_end":"2020-02-26","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2019-12-19","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics","Healthcare"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Valletta","Malta"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Valletta","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Malta"},"organizers":["QBS Program at Dartmouth"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
