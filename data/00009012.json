This year's IEF Conference sets a challenge to all researchers, policy makers and practitioners to ask critical questions and seek a range of answers about the uneven global landscape of SME internationalisation and how entrepreneurship and innovation connects the local with the global; the evolving international markets with social sustainability agendas; and acceptance of diversity with the rejection of reductionist exclusivity. The conference will provide a platform for the generation of new ideas, insights and practices related to the idea of an agenda for inclusive opportunity creation in our fragmented global environment.
