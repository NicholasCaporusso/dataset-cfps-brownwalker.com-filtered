{"name":"Pacific Conference on Economics and the Social Sciences","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.thinksisu.org/social-sciences","content":"We live in a world of abundant but not unlimited resources, requiring tradeoffs in making choices to achieve multi-attribute objectives. This is true at the level of an individual, a group, a society, or globally. How are decisions made at each level, and how should they be made? What happens when there is disagreement regarding objectives and collective choices? How do we address the inequalities that often result from collective action, and how should we? This conference brings together the disciplines of economics, political science, sociology, anthropology, geography and related fields to address topics of mutual interest.","date_start":"2016-05-13","date_end":"2016-05-15","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2016-04-11","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Business","Economics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["San Mateo","California","United States"],"name":"","street":"","city":"San Mateo","state":"California","ZIP":"","country":"United States"},"organizers":["The Sisu Advantage"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
