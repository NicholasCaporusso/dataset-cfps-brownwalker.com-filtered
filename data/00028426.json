But finally, little has been done for technocultures. The latter, unlike the former, are the result of the incorporation of digital into cultural forms or defined as “cultures influenced by technologies”: they can be extended to broad social categories (network culture and communication using Apps by groups of young people, connected cultures of professional communities of information or science, and their au-diences); limited to particular groups with their own technical culture (engineers who recognize themselves in the “Silicon valley” culture); characterize sets of cultural elements with blurred contours defined by aesthetics and expressivity (the poetics, language and narratives of technologies) and the imagination of technologies (cyborg culture, technopagan communities, cultures of artificial intelligence, etc.). On the basis of examples informed by empirical material, this issue of “Glocalism” will re-examine the forms of technoculture(s) in the context of globalization, their dynamics of glocalization and the ambivalent logics of the pressure to globalize despite local constraints, the complex interactions between culture and technology, in a series of contexts with varying depths of digitalization of culture. This approach aims at locating at the forefront of the reflection the “local” forms and forces, particularly cultural ones, that were previously questioned essentially from point of view of the globalization of Western technocultures. It will also nourish the debate on the consistency of the contested term “technoculture” and assess the relevance of an ap-proach in terms of glocalization.","date_start":"2022-01-31","date_end":"","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2022-01-31","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Social Sciences","Other"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Online Event",""],"name":"","street":"","city":"Online Event","state":"","ZIP":"","country":""},"organizers":["Glocalism.
