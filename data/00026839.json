{"name":"2nd International","series":"","short":"","website":"https://artificialintelligence.annualcongress.com","content":"Conference Series LLC Ltd organizes conferences around the world on all computer science subjects including Artificial intelligence and its related fields. Here we are happy to invite all Artificial intelligence/industrialists/ students to join our \"2nd International Conference on Automation and Artificial Intelligence\" scheduled to be held in London, UK during June 15-16, 2021\\. The Artificial Intelligence 2021 is initiated by Editors of Journal of Information Technology & Software Engineering Open Access, Journal of Global Research in Computer Science: Open Access, and Journal of Computer Science & Systems Biology: Open Access. Conference Series invites all the experts and researchers from the Automation and Artificial Intelligence sector all over the world to attend the “2nd International Conference on Automation and Artificial Intelligence (Artificial Intelligence 2021) which is going to be held on JUNE 15-16, 2021 at London, UK. Artificial Intelligence 2021 conference includes Keynote presentations, Oral talks, Poster Presentations, Workshops, and Exhibitors. Artificial Intelligence is a region of software engineering that emphasizes the production of intelligent machines that work and respond like people. Artificial intelligence is expert in studying how human brain thinks, learn, decide, and work while trying to solve a problem, and then using the products of this study as a source of increasing smart software and systems. In real-life, knowledge has some undesirable properties. In the modern world, Artificial Intelligence can be used in many ways to control robots, Sensors, actuators, etc., An automation system is a system that controls and displays building organization. These systems can be established in a few typical ways. In this segment, a general construction framework for a structure with complex requirements due to the action such as a consulting room will be described. The actual scheme frequently has some of the features and components described here but not all of them. The automation level consists of all progressive controls that regulate the field level devices in actual time. Online transaction is broadly utilized nowadays. This is one of the best examples of automation. In online shopping, reimbursement and checkout are through an online conversation system. Most other engineering majors work with Artificial Intelligence, but the heart of Artificial Intelligence is Automation and Automation Engineering across all the disciples. Artificial Intelligence 2020 conference is also comprised of Best Post Awards, Best Oral Presentation Awards, Young Researchers Forums (YRF), and also Video Presentation by experts. We are glad to welcome you all to join and register for the “2nd International Conference on Automation and Artificial Intelligence” which is going to be held during June 15-16, 2021 London, UK.","date_start":"2021-06-15","date_end":"2021-06-16","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2021-06-15","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics","Artificial intelligence"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["London","United Kingdom"],"name":"","street":"","city":"London","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"United Kingdom"},"organizers":[""],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
