We have gathered together invited speakers from around the world, who you might not otherwise have access to. This international event will discuss how the design and construction of new biological parts, devices, and systems, plus the re-design of existing, natural biological systems will be used for enhancing human health. Who Should Attend: Anyone interested in the design and construction of new biological parts or the re-design of existing, natural biological systems should find this meeting of value. We encourage questions, discussion and debate and have a relaxed atmosphere which generates maximum interaction online. After registration you will be connected to an online networking site where you will be able to have discussions with all participants of this event, before, during and after the meeting. The event will be recorded and available for all registered delegates up to a month after the event. So if you canâ€™t manage all the days, or the different time zones, you can still have access to the full event.","date_start":"2016-09-27","date_end":"2016-09-29","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2016-09-27","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Life Sciences","Biotechnology/ Bioinformatics","Biological Engineering & bioinformatics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Online Event",""],"name":"","street":"","city":"Online Event","state":"","ZIP":"","country":""},"organizers":[""],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
