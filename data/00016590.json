The conference is seeking to receive contributions by scholars who recognise that political science needs to vindicate its relevance by tackling today’s challenges while predicting the themes ahead. We aim to establish a hub for academics that engage with peers over the latest advances and research results in any sub-field of Political Science and International Relations both in the shape of empirical and theoretical work. The theme of the conference is meant to inspire and bring together academic leaders, researchers, and scholars who like to think outside the box and transcend their disciplinary domain. While offering a forum to established academics we also like to see proposals from a new generation of researchers as well as outstanding research students who like to share their work, receive feedback and exchange ideas with faculty from all around the world.
