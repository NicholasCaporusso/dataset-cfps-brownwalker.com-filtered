{"name":"International Conference:","series":"","short":"","website":"https://narrativesofdisplacement.lcir.co.uk","content":"The conference seeks to explore the narratives of displacement and to demonstrate the validity of a cross-disciplinary approach which brings together the historical, cultural, social and literary expertise in the handling of text. The conference will particularly focus on time and space representations and on treatment of the theme of cultural ambivalence and identity conflict. The subject of displacement will be regarded as both a migration, voluntary or forced, and a sense of being socially or culturally “out of place”. The conference aims to bring together scholars from different fields. We invite proposals from various disciplines including history, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, culture studies, media studies, political science, law, architecture, tourism, religious studies, literature, linguistics, psychology, etc. Proposals up to 250 words should be sent by 20 September 2021 to: displacement@lcir.co.uk.
