ARECONF 2024 presents a world-class experience to all its attendees as well as presenters. This education conference will delve into the latest developments and practices in the world of applied research. Previously, held as an e-learning conference, this event will be held on-site this year.

Our past education conferences have seen participants and presenters from several countries: Australia, the United States, Canada, Croatia, Malaysia, Iran, South Africa, China, Albania, and many more. We hope to see even more international attendees as we continue to build this conference to be a highly informative and useful event. Join this conference to observe, learn, and interact with a variety of accomplished academics, scholars, and leaders about all the fascinating discoveries in this field. Additionally, discuss and debate the common problems and challenges seen here, as well as come up with practical solutions. Finally, you can speak about your research or get published in distinguished academic journals.","date_start":"2024-07-19","date_end":"2024-07-21","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2024-06-28","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Education / Legal / Other","Education","Teaching","Deep Learning"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Copenhagen","Denmark"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Copenhagen","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Denmark"},"organizers":["Global KS"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
