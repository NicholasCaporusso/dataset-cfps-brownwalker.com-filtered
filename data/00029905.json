This scientific gathering has a goal to bring together people from various backgrounds, promote cross-pollination between diverse research domains, and expose and discuss cutting-edge theories, frameworks, techniques, tools, and applications. It is dedicated to providing a forum for exchanging the most recent research findings as well as sharing generous research methods. The experts and industry partners in attendance will give a terrific networking opportunity. The conference will feature keynote presentations and special talks by recognised specialists from prestigious regional and international institutes. Over the course of two days, internationally recognised speakers will discuss how their research has evolved in response to current difficulties, including inspirational lessons in material science and innovation.
