It is sponsored by The International Society for Applied Computing (ISAC) and The Technical Institute for Engineers (T.I.E.). During the upcoming conference, the invited renowned professors will share with us the recent innovations in the fields of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. The conference will mainly feature on keynote speeches as well as peer-reviewed paper presentations. In addition, social program or academic visit will be arranged to encourage communication, discussion or cooperation among the researchers in this field. We invite submissions of papers presenting an original high-quality research and development for the conference. All papers must be written in English and will be peer-reviewed by technical committees of the Conference and all accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings. \\*Conference Speakers: Keynote Speaker I: Prof. Koichi Asatani, Shanghai University, China (IEEE Fellow, IEICE Fellow) Keynote Speaker II: Prof. Ma Jianguo, Zhejiang University, China (IEEE Fellow, 浙江大学微纳电子学院教授、副院长) Keynote Speaker III: Prof. Bo Ai, Beijing Jiaotong University, China (IEEE Fellow, IET Fellow) (IEEE VTS Beijing Chapter Vice Chair IEEE BTS Xi'an Chapter Chair) Keynote Speaker IV: Prof. Farhad Shahnia, Murdoch University, Australia (IEEE Senior Member) \\*Call for papers: Machine Learning Deep and Reinforcement Learning Machine Learning for Network Slicing Optimization Machine Learning for 5G system Machine Learning for User Behavior Prediction New Innovative Machine Learning Methods Optimization of Machine Learning Methods Performance Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms Experimental evaluations of machine learning Machine learning for multimedia Machine learning for Internet of Things Machine learning for security and protection Distributed and decentralized machine learning algorithms Natural Language Processing Phonetics, phonology, and morphology Syntax, semantics, discourse, pragmatics, dialogue, and lexicon Mathematical, statistical, machine learning and deep learning models Word and sentence representation Language resources and corpora Electronic dictionaries, terminologies and ontologies Linked data POS tagging Semantic role labelling Word-sense disambiguation Multiword expressions Textual entailment Anaphora resolution Language generation Speech recognition Text-to-speech synthesis Multilingual NLP (for more topics: http://www.mlnlp2022.net/topic.html ) \\*Publication and indexing: ★MLNLP 2022 all accepted and registered papers will be published in the conference proceedings and will be indexed by EI Compendex, Scopus, INSPEC, EI's Engineering Information Index, ISI Thomson's Scientific and Technical Proceedings, ISTP/ISI Proceedings, and Current Contents on Diskette. ★MLNLP 2021 Conference Proceedings have been published by IEEE Conference Publishing Services in the IEEE Xplore (ISBN: 978-1-6654-3757-8) and indexed by Ei Compendex and Scopus successfully within 1 month after publication. ★MLNLP 2020 Conference Proceedings have been published by ACM (ISBN: 978-1-4503-8811-5) and indexed by EI Compendex and Scopus successfully within 1 month after publication! ★MLNLP 2019 Conference Proceedings have been published by ACM (ISBN: 978-1-4503-7261-9) and indexed by EI Compendex and Scopus successfully within 1 month after publication! ★MLNLP 2018 Conference Proceedings have been published by ACM (ISBN: 978-1-4503-6625-0) and indexed by EI Compendex and Scopus successfully within 1 month after publication! \\*Submission Methods: 1.Online Submission System: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/MLNLP2022 2.Submission Email: mlnlp@applied-computing.net Submission guidelines: http://www.mlnlp2022.net/submission.html \\*Join the conference as: Authors: Authors are expected to submit full papers to the submission system for further review by our Technical Committees.
