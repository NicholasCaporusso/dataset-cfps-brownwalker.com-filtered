The conference acknowledges necessary changes in systems and software thinking due to contemporary shifts of computing paradigm to e-services, cloud computing, mobile connectivity, business processes, and societal participation. By comparing novel approaches with established traditional practices and by evaluating them against systems and software quality criteria, ENASE conferences advance knowledge and research in software engineering, including and emphasizing service-oriented, business-process driven, and ubiquitous mobile computing. ENASE aims at identifying most hopeful trends and proposing new directions for consideration by researchers and practitioners involved in large-scale systems and software development, integration, deployment, delivery, maintenance and evolution. ENASE 2016 will be held in conjunction with ICEIS 2016 and GISTAM 2016\\. CONFERENCE AREAS: Each of these topic areas is expanded below but the sub-topics list is not exhaustive.
