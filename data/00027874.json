However, the communication, data management and security are emerging as a common research consideration to maintain the communication interoperability and reliability. In recent years, Internet of Things (IoT) is envisioned as a next big revolution in networks and communication by connecting the things to the internet via heterogeneous access networks that are enabled by various technologies such as wireless sensor networks, sensing & actuation, cyber physical systems, real-time web services and so on. With the huge number of objects/things/people connected to the internet, it becomes more important to collect the valuable information in an efficient way. This demands for the new research innovations in the emerging communication and networking technologies. In the aforementioned perspective, this International Conference on IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud (ISMAC 2021) aims to showcase the state-of-the-art research advances in the emerging communication architecture, protocols, services and applications.","date_start":"2021-11-11","date_end":"2021-11-13","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2021-11-01","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Palladam","India"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Palladam","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"India"},"organizers":["SCAD Institute of Technology"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
