{"name":"International Conference on Digital Forensics & Cyber Crime","series":"","short":"","website":"http://d-forensics.org/2016/show/home","content":"The Internet has made it easier to perpetrate crimes by providing criminals an avenue for launching attacks with relative anonymity. The increased complexity of the communication and networking infrastructure is making investigation of cybercrimes difficult. Clues of illegal activities are often buried in large volumes of data that needs to be sifted through in order to detect crimes and collect evidence. The field of digital forensics and cybercrime investigation has become very important for law enforcement, national security, and information assurance. This is a multidisciplinary area that encompasses law, computer science, finance, telecommunications, data analytics, and policing. This conference brings together practitioners and researchers from diverse fields providing opportunities for business and intellectual engagement among attendees.","date_start":"2016-09-28","date_end":"2016-09-30","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Business","Information-Technology","Cybersecurity & digital forensics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["New York City","United States"],"name":"","street":"","city":"New York City","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"United States"},"organizers":["EAI"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
