The field of robotics has made unimaginable progress in the past few decades. As a result, the application of robotics and automation engineering solutions have expanded exponentially: agriculture, construction, mining, healthcare, education, defense, architecture, and other industries. This event will explore trends and challenges, encouraging the attendees to actively participate in discussions, contribute to the shared knowledge pool, share their experiences, and think of creative solutions to the problems that the field faces both on macro and micro levels. While we hope to meet you in-person at the venue, we do understand that traveling to Brussels may not be possible for everyone interested in joining the event. That’s why the conference has the option of attending or presenting virtually. So no matter how busy your schedule is or the travel restrictions you may have, you are still able to enjoy the benefits of attending a premier robot conference. See you on 26 – 28 May 2023 in Brussels, Belgium!","date_start":"2023-05-26","date_end":"2023-05-28","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2023-05-05","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Other","Robotics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Brussels","Belgium"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Brussels","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Belgium"},"organizers":["STECONF"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
