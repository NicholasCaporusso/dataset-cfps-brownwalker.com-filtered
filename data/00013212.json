{"name":"The international conference On Resilient & Resposible Architecture & Urbabism","series":"","short":"","website":"https://www.ierek.com/events/resilient-responsible-architecture-urbanism#introduction","content":"The built environment has a major impact on how we experience the quality of our daily life. With a world population that is predicted to grow considerably, the demand for energy and resources is likely to increase and not diminish. Since the construction sector is currently responsible for 40% of energy consumption, 40% resource usage and 40% of waste globally, it is one of the most important sectors in which a real impact can be made to improve our ecological footprint. This means architecture and urbanism are facing a major challenge. But then still, finding answers in designing and realizing green objects and sustainable urban only will not be enough. Addressing these issues successfully can never be done without considering how man experiences the quality of the built environment. More than ever architecture and urbanism have the responsibility to include issues important to ordinary people, e.g. the affordability of housing, the accessibility of the urban environment for elderly, healthy and comfortable places to live, safe working conditions, new jobs and maintaining the quality of life in regional areas with a shrinking population. This demands an interdisciplinary approach for architects as well as urban designers and an integrated supply chain to execute the developed plans.","date_start":"2018-04-10","date_end":"2018-04-12","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2017-10-11","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Architectural/Environmental","Architecture & Civil Engineering"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Groningen","Netherlands"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Groningen","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Netherlands"},"organizers":["IEREK"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
