Currently, it has become a widely recognized goal for human society in many parts of the world. Hence, Sustainable development requires meeting the basic needs of all and extending to all the opportunity to satisfy their aspirations for a better life, maintaining the economic and ecological balance. Given this renewed interest in sustainable development, this year’s International Postgraduate Research Conference focuses on “Research for sustainable development, applications beyond publications\". Our objective is to reduce the gap between outcomes of researches and their usage in sustainable development of the country. We invite papers that explore the way disciplinary specificity and differences can enable (rather than impede) interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research. We believe that multidisciplinary and collaborative researches should be key focuses on future development and sustainability of researches themselves. To this end, we particularly welcome papers that focus on the dialectical relation between disciplinary specificity that strengthens collaborative work and that marks out the specificity of individual disciplines. http://bit.ly/IPRC2017","date_start":"2017-12-08","date_end":"","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2017-10-15","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Life Sciences","Other","Sustainable Development and Engineering"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Kelaniya","Sri Lanka"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Kelaniya","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Sri Lanka"},"organizers":["Faculty of Graduate Studies, University of Kelaniya"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
