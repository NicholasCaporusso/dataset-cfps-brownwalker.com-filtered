It is sponsored by The International Society for Applied Computing (ISAC) and The Technical Institute for Engineers (T.I.E.). During the upcoming conference, the invited renowned professors will share with us the recent innovations in the fields of Algorithms, Machine Learning and Signal Processing. The conference will mainly feature on keynote speeches as well as peer-reviewed paper presentations. In addition, social program or academic visit will be arranged to encourage communication, discussion or cooperation among the researchers in this field. We invite submissions of papers presenting an original high-quality research and development for the conference. All papers must be written in English and will be peer-reviewed by technical committees of the Conference and all accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings. \\*Conference Speakers: Keynote Speaker I: Prof. Yang Xiao, The University of Alabama, USA (IEEE Fellow, IET Fellow, AAIA Fellow) Keynote Speaker II: Prof. Alejandro F Frangi, University of Leeds, UK (IEEE Fellow) Keynote Speaker III: Prof. Xin Yao, Southern University of Science and Technology, China (IEEE Fellow) \\*Call for papers: Algorithms Competitive analysis Sorting algorithm Analysis of algorithms Polynomial time approximation scheme Computability theory Online algorithm Graph exploration algorithm Machine Learning Machine learning methods Machine Learning for 5G system Machine learning for multimedia Intelligent cloud-support communications Signal Processing Radar Signal Processing Rapid Prototyping and Tools for DSP Design Signal Processing for Communications Statistic Learning & Pattern Recognition (for more topics: http://www.amlsp2022.net/Call%20for%20Papers.html ) \\*Publication and indexing: ★All accepted and registered papers will be included in the Conference Proceedings and published by ACM (ISBN: 978-1-4503-9794-0), which will be archived in the ACM Digital Library, and indexed by Ei Compendex and Scopus. ★AMLSP 2021 Conference Proceedings have been published by ACM (ISBN: 978-1-4503-8586-2) and indexed by EI Compendex and Scopus successfully within 1 month after publication!
