ICT4AWE facilitates the exchange of information and dissemination of best practices, innovation and technical improvements in the fields of age-related health care, education, social coordination and ambient assisted living. From e-Health to intelligent systems, and ICT devices, this will be a point of interest for all those that work in research and development and in companies involved in promoting the well-being of aged people, by providing room for industrial presentations, demos and project descriptions. ICT4AWE 2016 will be held in conjunction with CSEDU 2016\\. Keynote Lectures ICT4AWE 2016 will have several invited keynote speakers, who are internationally recognized experts in their areas. Their names are not yet confirmed. CONFERENCE AREAS: Each of these topic areas is expanded below but the sub-topics list is not exhaustive.
