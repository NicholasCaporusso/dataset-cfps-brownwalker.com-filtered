{"name":"6th Asian Conference on Civil, Material and Environmental Sciences","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.accmes.org","content":"The current warming trend is of particular significance, as it brings severe and disastrous consequences and is now proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over decades. Endangering the survival of the Earthâ€™s flora and fauna, and the human race is no exception. Climate change also increases the appearance of more violent weather phenomena, drought, fires, heat/cold waves, the death of animal and plant species, flooding from rivers and lakes, the creation of climate refugees and destruction of the food chain and economic resources, especially in developing countries. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. The 6th ACCMES focus on global research challenges and solutions in the field of Climate Change and Global instability, we welcome new research findings, ideas and suggestions from potential researchers and activists. There will be main conference tracks underpinned by sessions around these but not limited to: - Climate Change - Disaster Reduction - Global Instability - Civil Sciences - Material Science - Environmental Sciences","date_start":"2020-07-07","date_end":"2020-07-09","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2020-03-05","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Physical Science & Math","Other","Climate Change"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Tokyo","Japan"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Tokyo","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Japan"},"organizers":[""],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
