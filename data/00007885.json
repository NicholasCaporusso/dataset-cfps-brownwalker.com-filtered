Bolstered by information technology developments, the extraordinary growth of fuzzy computation in recent years has led to major applications in fields ranging from medical diagnosis and automated learning to image understanding, decision and systems control. This conference intends to be a major forum for scientists, engineers and practitioners interested in the study, analysis, design, modeling and implementation of fuzzy systems, both theoretically and in a broad range of application fields. FCTA is part of IJCCI, the 8th International Joint Conference on Computational Intelligence. IJCCI 2016 will be held in conjunction with IC3K 2016\\.
