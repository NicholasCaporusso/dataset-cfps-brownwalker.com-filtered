{"name":"2022 IMB Conference: Epigenetics of Ageing: Responses to Adversity across Scales","series":"","short":"","website":"https://www.imb.de/seminars-meetings/meetings/2022-imb-conference-epigenetics-of-ageing-responses-to-adversity-across-scales","content":"Ageing is a challenge that affects all organisms. To cope with adversities that cause ageing, organisms have evolved protective mechanisms that promote resilience. These range from the molecular (e.g. biophysics of molecules, genetic and physiological) to the organismic (e.g. division of societal and ecological roles). Recent breakthroughs that integrate multidisciplinary teams and novel models have opened exciting new directions at the frontier of ageing research. This four-day conference brings together scientists from all fields with an interest in ageing to foster an integrated view of biological resilience during ageing. Session topics will focus on the evolution of lifespan, genome stability, germ and stem cells and ageing, metabolism and the microbiome, regeneration, stress and ageing, and phase separation.","date_start":"2022-06-28","date_end":"2022-07-01","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2022-05-16","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Life Sciences","Animal-Biology","molecular biology"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Mainz","Germany"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Mainz","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Germany"},"organizers":["Institute of Molecular Biology"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
