{"name":"Root Cause and Problem Solving","series":"","short":"","website":"https://bit.ly/32DtKdg","content":"The failure to find root causes is perhaps the greatest problem facing business today. In manufacturing operations, this inability to systematically search out and find root causes can mean the loss of customers and millions of dollars or even illness or death among consumers. By changing the way managers or even individual operators think, a new approach to putting problems to bed once and for all can be achieved. When a company fails to identify and solve root cause problems, the problems reoccur leaving all players frustrated and often “just living with the problems” or adding extra personnel or inspection and test costs to their operations. Learning to track down and resolve root causes is the skill that separates highly successful companies from those classified as second class. Why Should You Attend This webinar will take you through your manufacturing lines and paperwork bottlenecks to a new way of thinking and viewing material and paperwork flows. You will learn to question. You will learn to swim upstream and you will learn to teach others to do the same. Root causes are often simple to find or may require travel from the factory to the corporate headquarters to get at the source of problems. This webinar offers practical and immediate practical approaches to resolving root cause problems that you can put to immediate use. You do not need a Ph.D. to succeed. You do not need to become certified in SWOT, FMEA, 8-D or Ishikawa. You need to learn to be free to explore and solve on your feet without magical cookie-cutter approaches. While factories are often blamed for poor quality, missed shipment goals and excessive costs, root causes can be right under their noses or thousands of miles away. This course is an absolute must for any individual or group frustrated by the constant inability to produce a quality product on time so that line and shipment rejections are reduced (permanently) near zero. Now is the time to upgrade company knowledge and skills. Root cause analysis is far more than the 5 Whys. Problem-solving is not the same as adding inspection, rework and test.
