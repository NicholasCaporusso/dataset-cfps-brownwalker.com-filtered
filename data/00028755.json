The congress will be held in a hybrid format during May 16-17, 2022 at Tokyo, Japan and it will be centered around the theme “Thriving Sustainability: Multifaceted Aspects of Green Chemistry\". The Green Chemistry 2022 will showcase the most current breakthroughs in a number of disciplines, with a focus on scientific innovation that may be applied in the real world. The subjects covered in the sessions span from chemical energy conversion to pharmaceutical manufacturing and nanotechnology. The unifying denominator for the contributions will be the key Green Chemistry notion of \"design.\" The agenda of this global summit is to bring together a multi-disciplinary group of scientists and engineers from around the world to present and discuss groundbreaking ideas and research in green chemistry and renewable energy. The congress strives to provide forum for the creation of better technologically driven chemistry and engineering solutions that relieve pressure on Earth's resources, atmosphere, and ecological health is provided by engaging oral and poster presentations, plenary talks, keynote sessions and open discussions.
