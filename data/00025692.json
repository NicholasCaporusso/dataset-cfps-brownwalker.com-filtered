The course will focus on the idea of women in public space and think about the ways in which the city provides women new freedoms to think, to explore and to be. We will look at work by Virginia Woolf, Muriel Spark and Anita Brookner and discuss representations of the city landscape in specific texts. We will also engage with some theories and ideas of the city in modernism and critical theory. The workshop is designed and led by Dr Katherine Da Cunha Lewin. All the registered participants who will attend the workshop will receive certificates.
