The Nano Meet - 2022 aims to develop a critical assessment of existing work and future directions in nanotechnology research including nanomaterials and fabrications, nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, devices, and integration. This conference brings together key researchers from all over the world and from many sectors of academy and industry in the nanotechnology research field, with a special focus on materials It is the ultimate goal of Nano Meet - 2022 to become a leading conference in the world in advocating novel electronic and sensing devices using advanced nanomaterials. Nano meet - 2022 Flexible electronics have become fast-growing fields after the discovery of various nanomaterials especially in the area of flexible strain sensors. High flexibility, stretchability, sensitivity, and compatibility are some essential requirements of flexible strain sensors. Currently developed nanomaterials have shown excellent performances as functional materials in sensing devices. These materials are preferred over conventional materials due to their stable mechanical and electronic behavior in diverse applications. This article presents current research progress in flexible and stretchable strain sensors. We hope to see you at the World Summit on Nanotechnology and Nano Materials (Nano meet-2022) in Rome, Italy","date_start":"2022-08-22","date_end":"2022-08-23","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2022-07-25","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Material/Nanotechnology","Nanomaterials"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Online Event","Italy"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Online Event","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Italy"},"organizers":["Med wide group"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
