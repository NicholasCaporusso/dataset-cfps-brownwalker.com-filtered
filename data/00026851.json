(HEPO2021) 1-5 August 2021, in Athens, Greece, in a hybrid way (both F2F and remotely) Call for Participation: https://coming.gr/hepo2021-call-for-papers/ Submissions deadline for ALL formats proposals: Tuesday 16 March 2021 Submission of Full Papers: 29 June 2021 (except otherwise mentioned on the Acceptance Letter) The conference: 1-5 August 2021 After the organization of seven (7) successful Annual International Conferences (look at Previous Conferences of COMinG), the 2nd International Hellenic Conference on Political Sciences: Communicating in Politics? (HEPO2021), aims to provide an opportunity for Academics, Professionals and Industry Experts from Politics, with cross-disciplinary interests, to discuss the future directives and innovations in their discipline. This year, apart from the F2F conference, we propose remote participation, as some countries might still face travel restrictions. We will make our best to give participants (both face to face and remote) equal opportunities to meet, exchange, communicate. Additionally, registrants will be able to upgrade to in-person attendance if circumstances allow — or to shift from attending in-person to joining virtually if new restrictions keep them home. Our main priority is your health security and seeing what has happened around the world with COVID-19 we should not take risks, no matter how much we would like to physically meet. Please take a look at the Provisional Conference Program You may present a research paper, a poster, participate in a round table, propose a workshop and or just attend the conference. Please find here all the different formats you can propose for HEPO2020\\. For paper presentations, please submit your abstract by email to registration@coming.gr , in a .doc file using Abstract\\_template. Decisions are reached within 2 weeks after the abstract submission. Deadline to register and to submit full papers will be specified in your acceptance letter. We aim to establish a hub for academics that engage with peers over the latest advances and research results in any sub-field of Political Science, International Relations, and especially Political Communication, both in the shape of empirical and theoretical work. The theme of the conference is meant to inspire and bring together academic leaders, researchers, and scholars who like to think outside the box and transcend their disciplinary domain. While offering a forum to established academics we also like to see proposals from a new generation of researchers as well as outstanding research students who like to share their work, receive feedback and exchange ideas with faculty from all around the world. The interesting part is that this conference will take place in parallel with the 6th Annual International Conference on Communication and Management, with the purpose to help experts from different disciplines communicate and exchange.
