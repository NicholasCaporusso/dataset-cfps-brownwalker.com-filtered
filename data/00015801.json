{"name":"2018 AAG Conference: \"Advancing Not Retiring: Active Players, A Fair Future\"","series":"","short":"","website":"https://www.aagconference.asn.au","content":"The Australian Association of Gerontology (AAG) is hosting its 51st Annual Conference in Melbourne from Wednesday 21 to Friday 23 November 2018 with pre-conference Workshops held on Tuesday 20 November 2018\\. Everywhere we look we can see examples of fabulous older people who are ‘Advancing not Retiring’. Our 2018 AAG Conference in Melbourne will offer a fantastic opportunity to shed light on this theme as we present our research, practice and education about ‘active players, a fair future’. As we are starting to live longer we have more time to contribute to society, and every sector of society can have a role in making ageing a time of strong engagement. So, I would like to encourage as much diversity as possible in our abstracts from architects to gerontologists, discussing issues from the social to the clinical. As we promote diversity and engagement for our ageing population, it is not surprising to know that these elements are highly commended highlights of the AAG conferences. Our conferences are renowned as great networking and community building events and the organising team look for ways to improve every year. The conference will provide you with an opportunity to present world class research, education and practice and to hear other’s cutting-edge work. Melbourne is one of Australia’s great cities and I warmly welcome you to the 51st AAG Conference.","date_start":"2018-03-26","date_end":"2018-11-23","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2018-03-26","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Social Sciences","Other"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Melbourne","Australia"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Melbourne","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Australia"},"organizers":["Australian Association of Gerontology"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
