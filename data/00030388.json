{"name":"8th International Conference on Software Security","series":"","short":"ICSS 2022","website":"ICSS 2022","content":"8th International Conference on Software Security (ICSS 2022) December 23 \\~ 24, 2022, Sydney, Australia https://cndc2022.org/icss/index Scope & Topics 8th International Conference on Software Security (ICSS 2022) is traditionally, security in software has been thought to be something that can be easily added on as a patch, post-development, and sometimes even after the deployment of the software. According to the US-Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), “most successful attacks result from targeting and exploiting known, non-patched software vulnerabilities and insecure software configurations, many of which are introduced during design and code.” Hence, it is imperative that secure design, coding and testing principles as well as deployment and maintenance are thoroughly embedded in the software development lifecycle. At the same time, software security is very inter-disciplinary, as software is being developed for a variety of applications – web, Internet, database, single and distributed computer systems, etc. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: • Software Security Attacks and Solutions • Static and Dynamic Code Analysis for Software Security • Validation, Verification and Testing for Software Security • Virtualization and Cloud Computing for Software Security • Cryptography for Software Security • Firewalls and Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems for Software Security • Software Penetration and Protection • Measurements and Metrics for Software Security • Secure Software Development Lifecycle • Principles and Models for Secure Software Design • Secure Coding Standards and Their Implementation • Software Security for Wireless and Mobile Applications • Software Security for Database Systems • Software Security for Web and Internet Applications • Security of Open Source Software • Software Threats and Vulnerabilities • Risk Analysis for Software Security Paper Submission Authors are invited to submit papers through the conference Submission System by November 26, 2022\\. Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for this conference. The proceedings of the conference will be published by Computer Science Conference Proceedings in Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT) series (Confirmed). Selected papers from ICSS 2022, after further revisions, will be published in the special issues of the following journals • International Journal of Computer Networks & Communications (IJCNC) - Scopus, WJCI, ERA Indexed • International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA) - ERA, WJCI Indexed • International Journal On Cryptography And Information Security (IJCIS) • International Journal of Security, Privacy and Trust Management (IJSPTM) • International Journal of Software Engineering & Applications (IJSEA) • Information Technology in Industry (ITII) Important Dates • Submission Deadline : November 26, 2022 • Authors Notification : Dec 16, 2022 • Final Manuscript Due: Dec 19, 2022 Contact Us Here's where you can reach us : icss@cndc2022.org or icssconfe@yahoo.com For other details please visit : https://cndc2022.org/icss/index Submission Link : https://cndc2022.org/submission/index.php","date_start":"2022-12-23","date_end":"2022-12-24","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2022-11-26","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics","Information Security"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Sydney","Australia"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Sydney","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Australia"},"organizers":["https://cndc2022.org/icss/index"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":["icss@cndc2022.org","icssconfe@yahoo.com"]}
