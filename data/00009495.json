{"name":"The International Conference “Plant Genome Editing & Genome Engineering”","series":"","short":"","website":"http://viscea.org/index.php/plant-genome-edit","content":"Genome Editing and Genome Engineering are revolutionizing Life Sciences and Plant Biotechnology that seek to develop new technologies for the precise manipulation of genes and genomes in cellula and in vivo. In addition to its use for advancing our understanding of basic biology, genome engineering has numerous real-world applications, e.g. engineering plants that better provide fuel, food and industrial raw materials. Driven by advances in the CRISPR-toolbox for rapid, cheap, multiplex modification of genomes and breakthroughs in DNA synthesis technologies, the pace of progress enabled by these tools in the last 2 years has been breathtaking. The International Conference “Plant Genome Editing & Genome Engineering” to be held on July 3-4, 2017 in Vienna, Austria will discuss the advances in genome editing and engineering, notions, challenges, pros and cons, technologies and methods of applications of the genome editing tools like CRISPR/Cas9, TALENs, ZNFs & AAVs in plants. The case study and sessions will reveal the potential application of Genome editing tools plant biology and crop improvement. Special emphasis on CRISPR system addressing the concept, technology, challenges like off-target effects, efficiency improvement and delivery systems etc.","date_start":"2017-07-03","date_end":"2017-07-04","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2017-04-01","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Life Sciences","Plant-Biology","Plant science, biology and genetics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Vienna","Austria"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Vienna","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Austria"},"organizers":["Vienna International Science Conferences & Events Association (VISCEA)"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
