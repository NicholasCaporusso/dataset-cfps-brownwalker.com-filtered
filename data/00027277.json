Battcock (Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia, México), M. De Giuseppe (IULM, Italy), D. Estruch (Universidad Nacional de Buenos Aires, Argentina) In 2021, we will commemorate the fall of the ancient city of Mexico-Tenochtitlan after the war in Tlatelolco between Mexican forces and the Spanish army of Hernán Cortés and his allies. The effects of these events influenced the history of all societies around the world and, through this process, Mexican thinkers of the 19th century imagined the “old Mexican spirit” of the country. The year 1521 can be interpreted from other perspectives than simply those of the conquerors and the locally defeated. The commemoration in 2021 provides an opportunity to reread those events from a global point of view that must reveal – by searching through archives – to what extent this process modified the religious, political, economic and social experiences in other regions of the world. In this way, we propose that historical experience and practical use of archives are not a minor issue in the glocal approach: thinking of the possible complex glocal interconnections among archives as the core theme of historical research. Specifically, our interest is directed towards the evaluation of the archive’s role as a global place of exchange of an interconnected history in the local view of a bigger process. This concerns all hermeneutic and holistic views of social investigation, which discuss the configuration of archives as another crucial element of the contemporary age in Latin America: a peculiar region of a global planet and a glocal world.","date_start":"2021-05-30","date_end":"","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2021-05-30","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Arts & Humanities","History"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Online Event",""],"name":"","street":"","city":"Online Event","state":"","ZIP":"","country":""},"organizers":["Glocalism.
