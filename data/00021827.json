{"name":"9th International Conference on Simulation and Modeling Methodologies, Technologies and Applications - SIMULTECH 2019","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.simultech.org","content":"The purpose of the International Conference on Simulation and Modeling Methodologies, Technologies and Applications (SIMULTECH) is to bring together researchers, engineers, applied mathematicians and practitioners interested in the advances and applications in all fields of modeling and simulation. The specific topics listed under each of these tracks highlight the interest of this conference in aspects related to computing, including Conceptual Modeling, Agent Based Modeling and Simulation, Interoperability, Ontologies, Knowledge Based Decision Support, Petri Nets, Business Process Modeling and Simulation, amongst others. SIMULTECH focuses on bridging formal methods and real world applications; therefore authors should highlight the benefits of Simulation Methodologies and Technologies for industry and services, either in general or for particular applications. Ideas on how to solve business problems, using simulation and modeling methodologies and technologies, will arise from the conference. Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques and general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Papers describing original work are invited in any of the areas listed below. \n Conference Topics: \n Area 1: Simulation Tools and Platforms \n \\- Enterprise Resource Planning \n \\- Education and Training \n \\- eLearning Platforms \n \\- Laboratory Simulation Software \n \\- Computer Simulation Techniques \n \\- Case Studies \n \\- Petri Nets \n \\- Virtual Reality and Graphical Simulations \n \\- Discrete-Event Simulation \n \\- Security/Emergency Support Tools \n \\- Plant Simulation \n \\- Domain-Specific Tools \n \\- Serious Games \n \\- Team-Support Tools \n Area 2: Formal Methods \n \\- Security \n \\- Distributed and Parallel Simulation \n \\- Decision Support \n \\- Mathematical Simulation \n \\- Neural Nets and Fuzzy Systems \n \\- Risk Analysis \n \\- Verification and Validation \n \\- Co-Simulation \n \\- Planning and Scheduling \n \\- Ontologies \n \\- Real-Time Systems \n \\- Conceptual Modeling \n \\- Stochastic Modeling and Simulation \n \\- Dynamical Systems Models and Methods \n \\- Non-Linear Systems \n \\- Optimization Issues \n Area 3: Complex Systems Modeling and Simulation \n \\- Interoperability \n \\- Fluid Dynamics \n \\- Environmental Modeling \n \\- Green Technologies \n \\- Crisis and Conflict Management Simulation \n \\- Collaborative Systems \n \\- Business Process Modeling \n \\- Service Value and Supply Chains \n \\- Multiscale Simulation \n \\- Performance Analysis \n \\- Biological and Social Systems Simulation \n \\- Agent-Directed Simulation \n \\- Biologically Inspired Systems Simulation \n Area 4: Application Domains \n \\- Automotive Industry \n \\- Logistics \n \\- Intelligent Transportation \n \\- Robotics, Automation and Mechatronics \n \\- Hydraulic and Pneumatic Systems \n \\- Materials \n \\- Sport and Entertainment \n \\- Wireless Systems \n \\- Sustainable City and Regional Planning and Engineering \n \\- GIS/GPS Systems \n \\- Hardware in the Loop Simulation \n \\- Process Engineering \n \\- Smart Cities and Homes \n \\- Cloud Computing Systems \n \\- Modeling and Simulation of Internet of Things (IoT) Systems \n \\- Modeling and Simulation of Cybersecurity Protocols and Schemes \n \\- Data Analytics and Simulation \n \\- Simulation of Energy Systems \n \\- Security and Military \n \\- Construction Engineering and Project Management \n \\- Telecommunication Systems and Networks \n \\- Clean Energy and Power Systems \n \\- Electronics Design and Manufacturing \n \\- Industrial Processes \n \\- Healthcare and Elderly Care \n \\- Ad Rare Event Simulation and Co-Simulation ","date_start":"2019-07-29","date_end":"2019-07-31","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2019-06-05","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Prague","Czech Republic"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Prague","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Czech Republic"},"organizers":["INSTICC"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
