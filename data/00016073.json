{"name":"Global Congress on Renewable and Non Renewable energy","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.cognizancescientific.com/renewable-non-renewable-energy/index.php","content":"Scientific Cognizance warmly invites all the participants from all over the world to attend the International Conference on Renewable & Non Renewable Energy Sources during April 16-17, 2019 in Venice, Italy with the theme of â€œEmerging Technologies in Renewable & Non Renewable Energy \". Both Renewable & Non Renewable Energy comes under Natural Resources. A non-renewable resource is a resource that cannot be replenished as quickly as they are used. Non-renewable resources such as coal, petroleum, natural gas, and uranium require millions of years to form. The usage of nonrenewable resources often harms the environment. A renewable resource is a resource that can be replenished as quickly as they are used. Renewable resources include solar, water, wind, biomass, and geothermal energy. However, renewable resources are expensive, and tend to serve other purposes other than the creation of energy.","date_start":"2019-04-16","date_end":"2019-04-17","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2019-03-04","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Renewable Energy/Nuclear"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["venice","Italy"],"name":"","street":"","city":"venice","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Italy"},"organizers":[""],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
