{"name":"4th International Conference on Innovative Data Communication Technologies and Application","series":"","short":"","website":"http://icidca.com/2022","content":"Intelligent data communication technologies have recently emerged as a substitute for standard data-processing applications in circumstances where traditional approaches are incapable of dealing with large, complicated, and new forms of data. Traditional Big Data techniques and platforms are providing insufficient response with a lack of scalability, fault-tolerance, performance, and accuracy. Developing new architecture, framework, security and advanced programming models for performing data analysis will assist in properly handling the massive and new data categories. This 4th International Conference on Innovative Data Communication Technologies and Application (ICIDCA 2022) organized by RVS College of Engineering and Technology during 3-4, November 2022 at Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India intends to present the most recent research achievements and developments in the intelligent data communication, and analytics. We welcome research contributions on both theoretical studies and state-of-the-art real-time applications. The main emphasis of 4th ICIDCA 2022 will be on multidisciplinary research aspects spanning across the areas of big data, artificial intelligence, data analytics, machine learning for big data, computational intelligence applications, optimization techniques and real-time data visualization techniques.","date_start":"2022-11-03","date_end":"2022-11-04","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2022-10-01","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics","computer engineering"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Coimbatore","Tamil Nadu","India"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Coimbatore","state":"Tamil Nadu","ZIP":"","country":"India"},"organizers":[""],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
