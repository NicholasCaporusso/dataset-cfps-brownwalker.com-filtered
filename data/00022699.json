{"name":"2020 ICEASS @ GUAM: Immigration Integration & Challenges","series":"","short":"","website":"http://iceass.org/index.php","content":"Recently, the themes of migration and integration have been especially topical in Europe and in other parts of the world due to massive and ever-growing movement of population. These spreading in-flows of immigrants have a strong impact on the social, economic and political climate of host countries; therefore, there’s a need to review their immigration and integration policies to adjust to the processes of globalization. Integration has gained prominence at the time when international migration is steadily growing and diversifying. Integration has, therefore, become a central aspect that must be analyzed, supported and facilitated in contemporary societies because only successful integration builds communities that are stronger economically and more inclusive socially and culturally. This year, ICEASS, focusing on the issues of Immigration Integration & Challenges, together with TICEAS will hold our first-ever joint conference and open up a special session named: “Information Security and Applications”. We encourage submissions from both themes listed below, but aren’t limited to: TOPIC 1: Immigration Integration & Challenges TOPIC 2: Information Security and Applications","date_start":"2020-02-18","date_end":"2020-02-20","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2019-10-28","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Education / Legal / Other","Education","Education, teaching"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Tumon","Guam"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Tumon","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Guam"},"organizers":[""],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
