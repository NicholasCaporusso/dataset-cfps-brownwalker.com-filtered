Several architectures, learning strategies and algorithms have been introduced in this highly dynamic field in the last couple of decades. This conference intends to be a major forum for scientists, engineers and practitioners interested in the study, analysis, design, modeling and implementation of neural computing systems, both theoretically and in a broad range of application fields. Conference Topics:  Pattern Recognition  Industrial, Financial and Medical Applications  Computational Neuroscience  Neural Network Software and Applications  Neuroinformatics and Bioinformatics  Learning Paradigms and Algorithms  Supervised and Unsupervised Learning  Adaptive Architectures and Mechanisms  Support Vector Machines and Applications  Complex Artificial Neural Network Based Systems and Dynamics  Higher Level Artificial Neural Network Based Intelligent Systems  Bio-inspired and Humanoid Robotics  Image Processing and Artificial Vision Applications  Intelligent Artificial Perception and Neural Sensors  Modular Implementation of Artificial Neural Networks  Neural based Data Mining and Complex Information Processing  Neural Multi-agent Intelligent Systems and Applications  Self-organization and Emergence  Stability and Instability in Artificial Neural Networks  Neural Network Hardware Implementation and Applications  Neural Computation issues in Social Behaviour Emergence IJCCI KEYNOTE SPEAKERS Julian Togelius, Center for Computer Games Research, IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark Yaochu Jin, University of Surrey, United Kingdom IJCCI CONFERENCE CHAIR Joaquim Filipe, Polytechnic Institute of Setúbal / INSTICC, Portugal PROGRAM CHAIR Kurosh Madani, University of Paris-EST Créteil (UPEC), France PROGRAM COMMITTEE http://www.ncta.ijcci.org/ProgramCommittee.aspx NCTA Secretariat Address: Av.
