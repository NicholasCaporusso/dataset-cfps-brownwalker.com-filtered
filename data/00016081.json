{"name":"THE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON INNOVATIVE SIMULATION FOR HEALTHCARE","series":"","short":"IWISH 2018","website":"http://www.msc-les.org/conf/iwish2018","content":"A holistic view of healthcare leads to an interdisciplinary field of research ranging from life-science to management disciplines. The increasing computational power and the tight integration of natural and computational sciences open the doors to new paradigms in life science research. The huge complexity of biological systems let deterministic and deductive methods reach their limitations, thus large scale simulations together with advanced methods of modelling are new tools to get insight into the huge diversity of healthcare. This workshop, part of the I3M Multiconference, aims to bring together scientists from engineering, natural and life sciences to stimulate discussion on new methods and topics in the emerging field of healthcare. Tracks shall cover the main aspects of healthcare. It shall not only provide a forum for presentation of novel approaches and methods of advanced simulation for both modelling and analysis but also provide meaningful results and applications.","date_start":"2018-09-17","date_end":"2018-09-19","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2018-05-15","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics","Healthcare"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Budapest","Hungary"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Budapest","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Hungary"},"organizers":["Cal-tek S.r.l."],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
