{"name":"International Online Conference on Language","series":"","short":"","website":"https://language.lcir.co.uk","content":"The Conference invites scholars from the humanities and social sciences to explore whether language is, indeed, a meta-narrative that orderly homogenizes intellectual endeavors and contains self-validating, universal, prescriptive principles, or is itself replete with differences that reflect disciplinary, cultural, gender, ideological, and political interests. Is language, indeed, bewitching human intelligence? What can scholars prescribe for an apparent paradox: Disputes and conflicts are couched in language and, at the same time, language is the axis of their resolution? | Papers are invited on topics related, but not limited, to: The Neurology and Anthropology of Language Acquisition Languages as Variations on a Cognitive Matrix of Human Speciation The Limits of Meaning Transference: Lost in Transition Language as Vocalization of Thoughts Language and Violence Language and Laws: Is Free Speech in Trouble? Labels as Cultural Artefacts: The Case of Racial Classification Gendering and Language: Holy Texts, Biology, and Society Men, Women, and Communication Language as Representation of Reality Language as Imagination Unbound: Literature and Poetry | Proposals up to 250 words should be sent by 20 May 2020 to: language@lcir.co.uk. Download paper proposal form. Presented papers will be published in a post-conference volume. | Registration fee â€“ 90 GBP","date_start":"2020-08-08","date_end":"2020-08-09","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2020-05-20","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Arts & Humanities","Languages/Literature","Language and Literature"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Online Event",""],"name":"","street":"","city":"Online Event","state":"","ZIP":"","country":""},"organizers":["London Centre for Interdisciplinary Research"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":["language@lcir.co.uk"]}
