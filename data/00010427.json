{"name":"SmartMedDev 2017 - from lab to clinical practise","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.healthinf.biostec.org/SmartMedDev.aspx","content":"The goal of this special session is to discuss the problems hindering the widespread adoption of smart medical devices - software based, wireless, implantable and wearable. Many brilliant ideas remain at the level of the proof of concept and never reach the market or the clinical practice. We focus on high-safety health monitoring and life saving devices. We are especially interested in sets of heterogeneous devices aggregated around a common communication platform (smartphone), based on open standards. In our opinion, aside of technical problems, the adoption of such systems is restrained by organizational issues, like incorporating in therapies applied by hospitals and reimbursed by insurances. This may need a formal approval and calls for a well-organized quality monitoring. This year''s edition is technically sponsored by the World Federation on Soft Computing (http://softcomputing.org).
