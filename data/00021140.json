The conference was due to be held 5-7 May 2020 in A Coru√±a, Spain and will now be held 7-9 September 2020 in Bilbao, Spain. \\*\\*\\* The objective of this Conference is to review the challenges and new opportunities for contemporary architecture. These are a result of advances in design and new building technologies, as well as the development of new materials. Many of the changes are motivated by a drive towards eco-architecture, trying to harmonise architectural products with nature. Another important issue is the adaptation of the architectural design to the natural environment, learning from nature and traditional construction techniques.","date_start":"2020-09-07","date_end":"2020-09-09","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2020-05-07","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Architectural/Environmental","environmental engineering"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Bilbao","Spain"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Bilbao","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Spain"},"organizers":["Wessex Institute"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
