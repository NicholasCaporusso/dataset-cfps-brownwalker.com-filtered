{"name":"2019 IMB Conference “Chromosome Territories & Nuclear Architecture”","series":"","short":"","website":"www.imb.de/2019conference","content":"A fundamental property of genomes is their topological organisation in the 3D space of the cell nucleus. Methodological advances in microscopy and genomics have paved new ways for studying the genome architecture at unprecedented spatial resolution. Emerging evidence has uncovered basic principles of genome organisation and pointed to its key roles in gene expression, genome maintenance and human disease, yet, the genome structure-to-function relationship remains elusive. This three-day conference will bring together experts focusing on: (i) the mechanistic basis of chromatin interactions and structure, (ii) the recent advances in modeling chromosome organization and dynamics, and (iii) the contribution of nuclear organisation in health and disease. The event will coincide with the 75th birthday of IMB group leader Christoph Cremer, a pioneer of super-resolution microscopy, and it will honor his long and distinguished career.","date_start":"2019-10-30","date_end":"2019-11-01","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2019-08-31","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Life Sciences","Animal-Biology","Genetics, Genomics, Gene editing"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Mainz","Germany"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Mainz","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Germany"},"organizers":[""],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
