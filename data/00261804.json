{"name":"2nd International conference on Bioinformatics and computational studies","series":"","short":"ICBCS 2024","website":"https://icbcs2024.org/index","content":"2nd International conference on Bioinformatics and computational studies (ICBCS 2024) April 13-14, 2024, Virtual Conference https://icbcs2024.org/index Scope; The key goal of 2nd International conference on Bioinformatics and computational studies (ICBCS 2024) is to arrange opportunity for the participants to share their knowledge, innovations, recent advances in Bioinformatics, new ideas and experience in person to join from different parts on the world. Bioinformatics has become an important part of life sciences research by empowering new computational approaches. Computational studies and Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that progresses and applies computational methods to explore biological data collections such as protein samples, cell populations and genetic sequences for newer predictions or find out new Biology. We hope ICBCS outcome will lead to substantial contributions to the knowledge base which is up-to-date in scientific fields.
