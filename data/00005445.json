{"name":"Western Society of Criminology Conference 2015","series":"","short":"","website":"http://westerncriminology.org/conference.htm","content":"Western Division of the American Society of Criminology is an organization whose members pursue scholarly, scientific, and professional knowledge concerning the measurement, etiology, consequences, prevention, control, and treatment of crime and delinquency. Since becoming an independent organization in 1977, the WSC has continued to hold an annual meeting each year, usually in February. The location of the meeting changes each year to share the burden of travel equally among the membership. In selecting conference facilities, the Board extends considerable effort to find sites that are accessible by a number of airlines, serviced by a major airport, are centrally located in the region, and reflect members preferences. As such, we regularly shift the meeting from Southern, Northern, and Island destinations (e.g. Hawai'i) within the Western regions of the United States and Canada.","date_start":"2015-02-19","date_end":"2015-02-21","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2015-02-19","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Social Sciences","Criminology"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Phoenix","Arizona","United States"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Phoenix","state":"Arizona","ZIP":"","country":"United States"},"organizers":["Western Division of the American Society of Criminology"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
