{"name":"Work Up and Product Isolation, Virtual Training","series":"","short":"","website":"https://go.evvnt.com/576572-3?pid=4868","content":"This is a VIRTUAL short course that will look at the importance of designing simple, practical reaction quenches, work-ups and product isolations. This short course will discuss the importance of designing simple, practical reaction quenches, work-ups and product isolations for a range of reaction and product types e.g. highly exothermic quenches, products with poor stability, removal of reagent by-products, consideration of impurities and meeting the needs of process intermediates as well as final products. The focus of this short course will be to design processes suitable for large scale operation and the importance of laboratory experimental design and execution to adequately model the large-scale process. This online course will be of interest to anyone who are: Discovery/Synthetic organic chemists Process development chemists Anyone involved in carrying out practical chemistry When you register you will be sent links to join the on-line sessions.
