The Electroceramics for End-users X Conference is the next scientific event dedicated to present the latest research and development of electroactive technologies and devices, with a focus on piezoelectric and multifunctional materials. The conference brings an international community of both industry and academia together for discussion and networking. The program exists of lectures from invited speakers and lectures from speakers that are selected based on their abstract. The lectures are accompanied by poster presentations, offering additional opportunity for discussions with the authors. The day before the conference is reserved for our Winter School, concentrating on the processing of ferroelectrics; chemical solution deposition and inkjet printing; the elaboration process of piezoelectric ceramic materials and the piezoelectric, elastic and dielectric characterization of ferro-piezoelectric ceramics.","date_start":"2019-01-27","date_end":"2019-01-30","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2018-09-15","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Physical Science & Math","Physics","physics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Špindlerův Mlýn","Czech Republic"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Špindlerův Mlýn","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Czech Republic"},"organizers":["Institute of Physics CAS, Czech Republic"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
