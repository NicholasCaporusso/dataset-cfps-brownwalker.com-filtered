{"name":"4th International Conference on Inventive Research in Material Science and Technology [ICIRMST 2023]","series":"","short":"","website":"http://icirmst.com","content":"In this digital electronics, electronic materials are occupying an integral part on all electronic and electro-mechanical devices. Since, the performance any electronic applications are directly dependent on the materials used, the invention of advanced materials are becoming as the backbone of any electronic applications in order to upgrade its functionality as well as the capacity. The research and development on material science will remain as the starting point for future advances in electronics. Henceforth, this 4th International Conference on Inventive Research in Material Science and Technology \\[ICIRMST 2023\\] aims to report the science and technology of electronic materials. Also, ICIRMST 2023 intends to examine and showcase the new applications of semiconductors, optical and display materials, metallic and magnetic alloys and so on. Also, we welcome the research articles that report state-of-the-art methods for fabricating advanced materials and evaluate the physical, chemical, optical, and electronic properties.","date_start":"2023-01-20","date_end":"2023-01-21","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2023-01-01","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Electrical/ Electronic","Advanced Electronic Materials"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Coimbatore","India"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Coimbatore","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"India"},"organizers":["RVS Technical Campus"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
