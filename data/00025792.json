{"name":"Effective Line Clearance - Prevent Product Holds and Recalls the Easy Way","series":"","short":"","website":"https://www.complianceonline.com/pharma-product-clearance-webinar-training-706539-prdw?channel=brownwalker","content":"Within the Pharmaceutical Industry, the changeover from one product to another on a filling/packaging line, although relatively a simple concept, has significant implications from a regulatory standpoint if cross-contamination is permitted to occur. Preventing cross-contamination requires a precise accountable process to be properly executed. Within the industry, there is significant confusion concerning line clearance, cleaning and reconciliation. Often, these three distinctly different processes are intermingled diminishing the effectiveness of each. This webinar will present industry best practices for the documentation, execution, and accountability of line clearance. Line clearance documentation requirements are particularly important to effective line clearance performance and the FDA has specific expectations when it comes to that documentation.","date_start":"2020-10-16","date_end":"","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Medicine & Health","Pharmaceutical / Medicinal","Pharmacology & Pharmaceuticals"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Online Event",""],"name":"","street":"","city":"Online Event","state":"","ZIP":"","country":""},"organizers":["Compliance Online"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
