Why do international violence and other conflicts arise and how can they be prevented? What are the challenges unique to peacebuilding between nations as opposed to other groups (such as ethnic or religious groups)? In post-conflict situations, what are successful strategies for peacebuilding, such as those able to achieve security, the rebuilding of infrastructure, human rights protection and advocacy, humanitarian aid, and the prevention of future conflict? How have changing and rival conceptions of corporate identities and national sovereignty helped or hindered peace prospects? How does justice for victims of war and war criminals contribute to lasting peace? What are the roles of international law, national law, local governments, and NGOs? Which approaches to diplomacy, mediation, and conflict resolution are best suited to a global context? What are innovative strategies for addressing todayâ€™s specific conflicts?","date_start":"2020-02-29","date_end":"","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2019-11-15","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Social Sciences","Other"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Ashland","United States"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Ashland","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"United States"},"organizers":["Ashland Center for Nonviolence"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
