{"name":"International Conference on Ecocriticism and Environmental Studies","series":"","short":"","website":"https://eco.lcir.co.uk","content":"Multiple environmental crises are increasingly inescapable at both transnational and local levels and the role of the humanities in addition to technology and politics is more and more recognized as central for exploring and finding solutions. Representations of natureâ€™s agency have become central to many studies conducted in literature, culture studies, philosophy, history, sociology or political science. This conference aims to explore the relationship between the physical environment and text in its broader meaning as well as analyse the social concerns raised by environmental crises. We invite proposals from various disciplines including political sciences, history, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, literature, linguistics, etc. Proposals up to 250 words accompanied by a brief biographical note should be sent to: eco@lcir.co.uk.
