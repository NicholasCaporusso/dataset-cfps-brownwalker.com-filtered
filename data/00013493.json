Appropriate healthcare informatics provisioning involves processing specialized user centric knowledge that is private and of sensitive nature. Electronic health record systems provide opportunities for information sharing which promise improving healthcare services, for both healthcare providers and healthcare seekers. However, appropriate information management measures are essential for privacy preservation and reliability. Traditional measures may not be suitable for eHealth systems because, in eHealth systems, the roles of all stakeholders are not well defined. Healthcare professionals require ready access to as much information as possible to support informed decision making. However, patients may want to exercise control over the entities granting controlled access to their personal health information, with particular concerns for information privacy. Balancing these competing concerns is a major challenge in the implementation of successful e-Health systems. This workshop focuses on the major challenge in Health Informatics. We seek papers addressing the following issues in e-Health systems, but are not limited to Topics • Role of Big Data in eHealthcare • Role of Internet of Things in eHealthcare • Access Control • Vulnerability assessment • Mobile Identity management • Authentication, security access policies • Privacy-respecting Authentication • Privacy issues in the Internet of Things • Privacy issues in wireless networks • Security Management of M2M network • Testing and verification of eHealth • Simulation based methods in eHealth • Security and Privacy issues in eHealth • Formal methods in eHealth • Verification of eHealth software and equipment • Performance evaluation of eHealth systems • Open issues, surveys on eHealth • Secured network architectures for eHealth • eHeathcare Forensics and Investigation • Remote and wireless-based Biometrics system • Mobile malware • Mobile botnets • Security and privacy issues in Smartphones • Intrusion and fraud detection • Socio-economic issues Important Dates Paper Submission: Nov. 27, 2017 Acceptance Notification: Dec. 22, 2017 Advance Registration: Jan. 12, 2018 Camera Ready Submission: Jan. 12, 2018 ITNG Community https://plus.google.com/communities/109649173808139931083","date_start":"2018-04-16","date_end":"2018-04-18","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2017-11-27","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics","Information technology systems (IT)"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Las Vegas","Nevada","United States"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Las Vegas","state":"Nevada","ZIP":"","country":"United States"},"organizers":["Phase"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
