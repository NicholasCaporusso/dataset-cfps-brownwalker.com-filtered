Scientists currently debate the advancements in Science, Health and Engineering . New technology may be able to create many materials and devices with a vast range of applications, such as in Science, medicine, electronics, biomaterials energy production, and consumer products. On the other hand, recent technology raises many of the same issues as any new technology, including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of materials and their potential effects on global economics, as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios. These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of new technology is warranted. This International Conference offers an opportunity for exchange of thoughts and authoritative views by chief scientists as well as business tycoons and investors in the field of Science, Health and Engineering","date_start":"2020-04-18","date_end":"2020-04-19","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2020-04-13","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Electrical/ Electronic","Life Sciences (nature)"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["chennai","India"],"name":"","street":"","city":"chennai","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"India"},"organizers":[""],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
