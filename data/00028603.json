{"name":"International Conference \"Faces of War\"","series":"","short":"","website":"https://warstudies.lcir.co.uk","content":"War has been a constant aspect of human eras since ancient times. In fact, the idea of conflict as a means of achieving useful results has always been present in the history of evolution. Even if after the end of the Second World War, when a new peaceful approach towards dispute resolution has been promoted by the most powerful nations in the world, tensions have risen again in the last few decades, particularly in some territories of the world. As 2021 marked the thirtieth anniversary since the outbreak of the Yugoslaw Wars and the end of the First Gulf War to name but a few, it is necessary to examine the themes and approaches studied in the field of War Studies and to offer a contribution towards a careful analysis of future scenarios. We invite academics from different backgrounds, including but not limited to history, philosophy, law, politics, sociology, literature, religion, economics, art, geography, anthropology, psychology, war industry, military science and cyberscience. Paper proposals should be sent by 15 December 2021 to: warstudies@lcir.co.uk. Please download Paper proposal form.","date_start":"2022-03-19","date_end":"2022-03-20","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2021-12-15","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Arts & Humanities","History","war studies"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["London","United Kingdom"],"name":"","street":"","city":"London","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"United Kingdom"},"organizers":["London Centre for Interdisciplinary Research"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":["warstudies@lcir.co.uk"]}
