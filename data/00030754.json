{"name":"International Conference on Innovative Data Communication Technologies and Application","series":"","short":"ICIDCA 2023","website":"http://icidca.com/2023","content":"The goal is to bring together the recent advances in communication intelligence, data computing models, algorithms and simulations to analyse and optimize various complex problems. This conference aims to create a new discipline in communicational intelligence and data computing by combining contemporary computational methods, data communication, software engineering, machine learning, communicational intelligence, simulations and ancillary technologies to address complexities in advanced computing applications in a smart way which is far beyond the scope of traditional data computing methods and technologies. The International Conference on Innovative Data Communication Technologies and Application (ICIDCA 2023), is an international forum on the theory, design, analysis, implementation and application of distributed systems and networks. We solicit papers in all areas of distributed computing. Papers from all viewpoints, including theory, practice, and experimentation, are welcome. The common goal of the conference is to improve understanding of the principles underlying distributed computing.","date_start":"2023-03-14","date_end":"2023-03-15","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2023-02-25","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Electrical/ Electronic","DATA COMPUTING"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Uttarakhand","India"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Uttarakhand","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"India"},"organizers":["Graphic Era Hill University"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
