{"name":"The Tenth International Conference on Advances in Satellite and Space Communications","series":"","short":"","website":"http://iaria.org/conferences2018/SPACOMM18.html","content":"The SPACOMM series of events constitutes an attempt to evaluate the state of the art on academia and industry on the satellite, radar, and antennas based communications bringing together scientists and practitioners with challenging issues, achievements, and lessons learnt. Significant efforts have been allotted to design and deploy global navigation satellite communications systems, Satellite navigation technologies, applications, and services experience still challenges related to signal processing, security, performance, and accuracy. Theories and practices on system-in-package RF design techniques, filters, passive circuits, microwaves, frequency handling, radars, antennas, and radio communications and radio waves propagation have been implemented. Services based on their use are now available, especially those for global positioning and navigation. For example, it is critical to identify the location of targets or the direction of arrival of any signal for civilians or on-purpose applications; smarts antennas and advanced active filters are playing a crucial role. Also progress has been made for transmission strategies; multiantenna systems can be used to increase the transmission speed without need for more bandwidth or power. Special techniques and strategies have been developed and implemented in electronic warfare target location systems.","date_start":"2018-04-22","date_end":"2018-04-26","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2017-12-22","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics","Space science"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Athens","Greece"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Athens","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Greece"},"organizers":["IARIA"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
