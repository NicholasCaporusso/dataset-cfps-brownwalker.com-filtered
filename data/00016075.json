As tradition the conference focuses on Modeling & Simulation in Industry taking into consideration both applications and theoretical approaches. The conference proposes a multi-sides perspective to Modeling & Simulation environment. Tracks organization is intended to cover different research macro-areas dedicated to Industrial Engineering, Effective Design, Business, Economy and Finance, Medicine, Methodologies, Techniques and Applications. Such framework gives to scientists, technicians and users the opportunity to interact, collaborate on the most challenging research topics in the field of Modeling & Simulation. You can find different topics, such as: • Discrete and Combined Simulation • Soft Computing & Simulation • Virtual Reality and Visualization • Modeling, Simulation and Prototyping • Modeling & Simulation for the Industry Services Simulation and Scheduling • Risk Management by Modeling & Simulation • Simulation in Finance and Finance Services • Data Mining and ERP Systems","date_start":"2018-09-17","date_end":"2018-09-19","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2018-05-15","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics","industrial engineering & design"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Budapest","Hungary"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Budapest","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Hungary"},"organizers":["Cal-tek S.r.l."],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
