{"name":"3rd Edition of Singapore Nursing Research Conference","series":"","short":"","website":"https://nursingresearchconference.com","content":"Given the huge success of the previous conferences and the strong interest in Nursing 2022, we look forward to welcoming you at our “3rd Edition of Singapore Nursing Research Conference” scheduled during March 16-18, 2023 at Singapore. Considering the current unprecedented challenges, we have chosen a hybrid format with on-site as well as online editions for this conference. The congress will be centred around the theme “Exploring Challenges in Nursing Research: The Unsung Frontline Warriors’ Field”. The limits of the global health system have become evident, and socioeconomic determinants have never prioritized their influence. Today, nurses are more than ever needed to combat the worldwide pandemic. It is now the time to initiate a dialogue, in order to improve cultural competence, coherence and equality of healthcare for all individuals, in this vital area of study. During the three-day event there will be a myriad of presentations, including keynote speeches, oral presentations and poster presentations, giving delegates the opportunity to hear, in a myriad context, not only the latest research and innovations in education, but also to fully participate in the interactive program.
