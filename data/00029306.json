{"name":"Sustainability In Creative Industry","series":"","short":"","website":"https://bit.ly/3n8DeYg","content":"The first edition of the international conference on ENVISION will work towards studying several aspect that influence the sustainable growth in creative industry by using Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The Covid 19 pandemic, which is still ongoing today, is a catalyst that transforms various fields, including the creative industry. Although sustainability is not a newly developed topic, as an industry that contributes to economic, social, cultural, and even environmental development, the discussions about sustainable growth in the creative industry are required to be studied continuously. Literally translated, sustainable development can be defined as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” Hence, the creative economy is not only one of the most rapidly growing sectors of the world economy, but it is also a highly transformative one in terms of income generation, job creation and export earnings. It empowers people to take ownership of their own development, and stimulates the innovation and creativity which can drive inclusive and sustainable growth.","date_start":"2022-11-10","date_end":"2022-11-11","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2022-05-14","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Other","Virtual Reality"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Online Event",""],"name":"","street":"","city":"Online Event","state":"","ZIP":"","country":""},"organizers":["IEREK"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
