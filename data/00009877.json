{"name":"AAG 2016 Conference - Capitalising on the Ageing Dividend: Re-Imagining our Future","series":"","short":"","website":"http://aagconference.asn.au","content":"In Canberra, the nationâ€™s capital, this conference will provide an opportunity to explore the future of ageing, and how we can best capitalise on the social and economic potential of our ageing society. The inter-generational and social implications of demographic change and current policies attempting to address the needs of an ageing population cannot be ignored. There needs to be more active consideration of the enormous positive economic and social contributions of older people to our communities and the broader society. This conference will provide a forum to reflect on and re-imagine the incredible potential of our ageing society, now and into the future. It will encourage debate on the nature of our society and the importance of ageing within it and to demonstrate how ground-breaking research and evidence-based policy can harness the great value of our diverse and ageing population for the benefit of all. Discover the latest developments in the field, hear new research and learn about best-practice in the industry. Get involved with the only evidence based multidisciplinary conference on ageing in Australia and make new connections with professionals from all over the country and overseas.","date_start":"2016-11-02","date_end":"2016-11-04","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Medicine & Health","Other"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Canberra","Australia"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Canberra","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Australia"},"organizers":["Australian Association of Gerontology"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
