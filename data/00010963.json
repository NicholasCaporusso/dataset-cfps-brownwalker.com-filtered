{"name":"Understanding Our Gun Culture","series":"","short":"","website":"http://acn.nationbuilder.com","content":"Very few topics generate as much controversy as the role of guns in American society. According to most estimates, not only are there more guns than people in the United States, there are also far more gun deaths per capita in the US than in any other developed country. While almost everyone agrees that there is too much gun violence, there are serious disagreements about how to address it. The goal of this conference is to gain insight about the complex issues associated with the widespread availability and use of guns in American society. In order to enhance the discussion, we are seeking to understand the issues through evidence-based presentations from a variety of academic disciplines. Both theoretical and practical considerations are welcome. While some presentations may address practical solutions for enhancing gun safety or minimizing gun violence, the main focus should be upon understanding the issue rather than advocating for particular viewpoints. â€‹","date_start":"2017-03-31","date_end":"2017-04-01","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2017-01-22","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Social Sciences","Other"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Ashland","Ohio","United States"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Ashland","state":"Ohio","ZIP":"","country":"United States"},"organizers":["Ashland Center for Nonviolence"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
