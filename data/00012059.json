Nonetheless, we cannot neglect the responsibility of acting with the best of our knowledge to ensure that our actions do not hinder the opportunities and lives of future generations through implementing ecological and sustainable design and development. This conference aims to enhance and carefully maneuver through the many roles of sustainable architecture in improving the quality of life and the built environment in developing countries. It seeks to, initially, reduce the negative impact of buildings and, secondly, to conserve energy and enhance the ecology. Both can be achieved through the use of sustainable building materials, saving energy, and using renewable energy, and many more implementations. - See more at: http://www.ierek.com/events/improving-sustainability-concept-developing-countries-2/#sthash.KepLDQyg.dpuf","date_start":"2017-12-12","date_end":"2017-12-14","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2017-06-08","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Architectural/Environmental","Architecture & Civil Engineering"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Cairo","Egypt"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Cairo","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Egypt"},"organizers":["IEREK"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
