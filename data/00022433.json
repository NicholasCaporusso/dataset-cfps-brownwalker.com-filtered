{"name":"8th International Conference on e-Democracy: Safeguarding Democracy and Human Rights in the Digital Age","series":"","short":"","website":"www.edemocracy2019.eu","content":"The ever-evolving digital age is becoming more intelligent and the future internet is shaping up. Technologies supporting the digital transformation, such as artificial intelligence, the internet of things, blockchain technologies, and robotics are developing in unprecedented rhythms. A new digital environment emerges, promising a lot, but also raising concerns about democracy itself and individual rights and freedoms. The relatively recent Cambridge Analytica scandal has profoundly influenced public opinion and -as written by many- has changed the world and the way citizens see their digital future. The effects of fake news and targeted political campaigns enabled by data misuse on democratic processes raise serious concerns. There are also fears of affecting the outcome of a democratic election itself. Moreover, the rapid development of technologies supporting the digital transformation, which is largely driven by significant economic benefits, raises concerns about the impact on privacy and, in general, on individual rights and freedoms. How can we safeguard our democracy against such threats? How can we create an intelligent digital world while ensuring individual rights and freedoms? Will our future digital world be privacy-friendly and secure to withstand attacks and malicious activities? Which ethical principles should govern the evolution of our digital future? Will this fast moving and intelligent digital world be trustworthy and embraced by the citizens? These are the questions and the focus of the 8th occasion of the International Conference on e-Democracy that will be held in Athens, the cradle of democracy, on 12-13 December 2019\\.
