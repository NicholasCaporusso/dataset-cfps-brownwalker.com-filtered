The conference features the theme of English as a Medium of Instruction in Higher Education: Practices and Challenges. As EMI (English as a Medium of Instruction) quickly spreads further and further, it is important that scholars, experts, practitioners, and other stakeholders assemble to share their experiences in and studies on EMI. The 2022 International Conference on Bilingual Education thus serves the best venue for addressing the theories that support EMI, the pedagogies that it has been implemented with, the actual practices that we observe, and the changes, positive or negative, that we and learners have experienced. We look forward to welcoming you.
