The period for submitting abstracts and papers to this conference continues to remain open. \\*\\*\\* The conference covers a series of important topics of current research interests and many practical applications. It is concerned with all aspects of Risk Analysis and hazard mitigation, associated with both natural and anthropogenic hazards. Current events help to emphasise the importance of the analysis and management of risk to planners and researchers around the world. Natural hazards such as floods, earthquakes, landslides, fires and others have always affected human societies. The more recent emergence of the importance of man-made hazards is a consequence of the rapid technological advances made in the last few centuries. The interaction of natural and anthropogenic risks adds to the complexity of the problems.","date_start":"2020-06-23","date_end":"2020-06-25","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2020-06-22","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Physical Science & Math","Other","Risk Management"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Online Event",""],"name":"","street":"","city":"Online Event","state":"","ZIP":"","country":""},"organizers":["Wessex Institute"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
