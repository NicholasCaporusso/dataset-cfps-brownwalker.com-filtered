Despite the passing of a century and signiﬁcant advances in technology, accidents still occur and 80% are considered attributable to ‘human error’. This course discusses Leadership, Followership and Management and considers the importance of a just culture in the shipping industry with the aim of reducing such error. The course introduces current leadership and management thinking and reinforces it with case studies in the maritime sector and through individual reﬂection and group work. It examines how risk should be managed at sea and draws upon case studies to create a framework through which the manager can ensure that operations are conducted safely.","date_start":"2018-11-12","date_end":"2018-11-13","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Education / Legal / Other","Education","shipping & marine transport"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Singapore","Singapore"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Singapore","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Singapore"},"organizers":[""],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
