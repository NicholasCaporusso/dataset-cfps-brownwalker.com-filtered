{"name":"2nd International Conference on Urban Agriculture and City Sustainability","series":"","short":"","website":"https://www.wessex.ac.uk/conferences/2020/urban-agriculture-2020","content":"The aim of the meeting is to review and discuss ways in which urban agriculture can contribute to achieving sustainable cities. As urban populations continue to increase it is essential to consider ways of reducing their impact in terms of use of natural resources, waste production and climate change. The increasing number of people in cities requires new strategies to supply the necessary food with limited provision of land and decreasing resources. This will become more challenging unless innovative solutions for growing and distributing food in urban environments are considered.","date_start":"2020-09-29","date_end":"2020-10-01","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2020-05-29","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Life Sciences","Other","Urban Studies, Planning & Design"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Valencia","Spain"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Valencia","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Spain"},"organizers":["Wessex Institute"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
