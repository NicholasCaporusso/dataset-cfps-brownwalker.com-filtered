{"name":"Convergence: Credential Innovation in Higher Education","series":"","short":"","website":"https://conferences.upcea.edu/convergence2024","content":"Convergence: Credential Innovation in Higher Education examines new and emerging trends and models, especially at the institutional level, in the emergent field of alternative credentials. Presented jointly by UPCEA and AACRAO, two of the organizations most critical to the future development and implementation of innovative credentials, this event brings together key campus stakeholders in credential innovation—deans of professional education, chief online learning officers, registrars, and their staff—to define and develop their institutional strategy with respect to alternative credentials. Convergence reflects the confluence of factors leading to the evolution of this fast-moving, but still largely amorphous movement. This event serves as a unique platform for professionals from diverse backgrounds to converge, connect, and catalyze positive change in our ever-evolving educational landscape. From thought-provoking general sessions to interactive workshops, roundtables, and other special session formats presented by institutional colleagues, Convergence promises to be a dynamic and enriching experience for all attendees. As at the sold-out, inaugural 2023 event, Convergence attendees will explore successful and emerging models of credential innovation, connect and collaborate with other credentials stakeholders from across the higher education community, and begin planning for the advancement of credential innovation on their campuses at the 2024 conference. Who should attend? Members of UPCEA, members of AACRAO, and others engaged in credential innovation in the higher education space. Convergence offers content for senior leaders responsible for institutional strategy for alternative credentials; other administrators working in the space; and registrars and other related professionals.","date_start":"2024-09-30","date_end":"2024-10-02","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Education / Legal / Other","Education","Higher Education","Education"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["New Orleans","LA United States"],"name":"","street":"","city":"New Orleans","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"LA United States"},"organizers":["Presentation by UPCEA and AACRAO"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
