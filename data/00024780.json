Recent, the data intelligence domain combines with the increasing efforts of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Cognitive science to study and develop a deeper understanding of the information processing systems. Furthermore, the new cognitive informatics tools, algorithms and methods that mimic the mechanisms of the human brain will lead to an impending revolution in understating a large amount of data generated by various smart applications. This International Conference on Data Intelligence and Cognitive Informatics \\[ICDCI 2020\\] welcomes researchers, academicians, scholars, and industrialists across the globe to join the international research initiative on data intelligence and cognitive informatics towards investigating the evolving information processing systems, and for the development of next-generation cognitive informatics and communication technologies.","date_start":"2020-07-08","date_end":"2020-07-09","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2020-06-20","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Electrical/ Electronic"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Tamil Nadu","India"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Tamil Nadu","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"India"},"organizers":["SCAD College of Engineering and Technology"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
