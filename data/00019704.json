{"name":"International Conference on Intelligent Communication Technologies and Virtual Mobile Networks","series":"","short":"ICICV 2019","website":"http://icicv.org/index.html","content":"ICICV 2019 aims to bring together leading academic scientists, researchers and research scholars to exchange and share their experiences, the state of the art and practice of cloud computing, identify emerging research topics, communication technologies and define the future of intelligent communication approaches, cloud computing and research results about all aspects of Engineering Technology and Innovation. All topics regarding cloud computing align with the theme of Virtual Mobile Cloud and Communication Technologies. The integration of Virtual mobile cloud computing and communication technologies and engineering permits new applications that provide resources and services on an intelligent basis, process big data collected from mobile sensors, and assist Internet of things with the massive cloud-based backend, where the 5G technology is expected to be an important enabler of this integration. Such applications will have incredible impacts on almost every feature of our daily life, including transportation, e-commerce, healthcare, safety and location privacy, smart home and smart city, social interaction, and many more. We will celebrate our 2019 version of gathering, to strive to advance the largest international professional forum on virtual mobile cloud computing and communication technologies.","date_start":"2019-02-14","date_end":"2019-02-15","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2019-01-05","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Tirunelveli","India"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Tirunelveli","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"India"},"organizers":["Francis Xavier Engineering College"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
