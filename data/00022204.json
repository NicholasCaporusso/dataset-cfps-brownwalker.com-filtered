{"name":"15th International Conference on Computer Vision Theory and Applications - VISAPP 2020","series":"","short":"","website":" http://www.visapp.visigrapp.org ","content":"The International Conference on Computer Vision Theory and Applications aims at becoming a major point of contact between researchers, engineers and practitioners on the area of computer vision application systems. Five simultaneous tracks will be held, covering all different aspects related to computer vision: Image Formation and Preprocessing; Image and Video Analysis and Understanding; Motion, Tracking and Stereo Vision; and Applications and Services. We welcome papers describing original work in any of the areas listed below. Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques as well as general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Paper acceptance will be based on quality, relevance to the conference themes and originality. The conference program will include both oral and poster presentations. Special sessions, dedicated to case-studies and commercial presentations, as well as technical tutorials, dedicated to technical/scientific topics, are also envisaged. \n \n Conference Topics: \n Area 1: Image and Video Formation, Preprocessing and Analysis \n \\- Image Formation, Acquisition Devices and Sensors \n \\- Device Calibration, Characterization and Modeling \n \\- Image Enhancement and Restoration \n \\- Image and Video Coding and Compression \n \\- Multimodal and Multi-Sensor Models of Image Formation \n \\- Image Registration \n \\- Segmentation and Grouping \n \\- Early and Biologically-Inspired Vision \n \\- Color and Texture Analyses \n \\- Shape Representation and Matching \n \\- Features Extraction \n \\- Visual Attention and Image Saliency \n Area 2: Image and Video Understanding \n \\- Cognitive Models for Interpretation, Integration and Control \n \\- Computational Photography \n \\- Deep Learning for Visual Understanding \n \\- Near Duplicate Image Retrieval \n \\- Machine Learning Technologies for Vision \n \\- Face and Expression Recognition \n \\- Content-Based Indexing, Search, and Retrieval \n \\- Object and Face Recognition \n \\- Object Detection and Localization \n \\- Categorization and Scene Understanding \n \\- Event and Human Activity Recognition \n Area 3: Motion, Tracking and Stereo Vision \n \\- Image-Based Modeling and 3D Reconstruction \n \\- Stereo Vision and Structure from Motion \n \\- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping \n \\- Optical Flow and Motion Analyses \n \\- Tracking and Visual Navigation \n \\- Video Surveillance and Event Detection \n \\- Video Stabilization \n \n Area 4: Mobile and Egocentric Vision for Humans and Robots \n \\- Understanding from Wearable and Mobile Cameras \n \\- Gaze Tracking and Estimation \n \\- Mobile and Egocentric Object Detection and Recognition \n \\- Mobile and Egocentric Action Recognition \n \\- Mobile and Egocentric Summarization \n \\- Mobile and Egocentric Behavioural Analysis \n \\- Egocentric Vision for Learning to Act \n \\- Anticipation and Forecasting from Egocentric Vision \n \\- Mobile and Egocentric Localization \n \\- Egocentric Vision for Interaction Understanding \n \\- Mobile Vision \n \\- First Person Vision \n \\- Vision for Robotics \n \\- Active Vision \n \n Area 5: Applications and Services \n \\- Entertainment Imaging Applications \n \\- Media Watermarking and Security \n \\- Multimedia Forensics \n \\- Assistive Computer Vision \n \\- Mobile Imaging \n \\- Imaging and Vision for Cultural Heritage \n \\- Camera Networks and Vision \n \\- Document Imaging in Business \n \\- Medical Image Applications \n \\- Pervasive Smart Cameras \n \\- Human and Computer Interaction \n \\- Digital Photography ","date_start":"2020-02-27","date_end":"2020-02-29","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2019-10-04","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics","computer vision"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Valletta","Malta"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Valletta","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Malta"},"organizers":["INSTICC"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
