{"name":"Memory and the Unconscious Workshop","series":"","short":"","website":"https://memory.lcir.co.uk/memory-unconscious","content":"In the workshop with Mary Wild (the creator of the PROJECTIONS lecture series at Freud Museum London), we will examine the connection between memory and the body as represented in cinema. The proposition is that precisely that which we try to eliminate from consciousness becomes stored as physiological symptoms. The body comes to functions as a warped communicative device, fashioning trauma into future symptoms, urging us to remember. Even as language breaks down, our symptoms do all the talking for us. The following films will be discussed (advanced viewing is optional; brief scenes will be shown): Upgrade (2018, dir. Leigh Whannell), Black Swan (2010, dir. Darren Aronofsky), Videodrome (1983, David Cronenberg), and Mysterious Skin (2004, Gregg Araki). The workshop is scheduled on Sunday, 12 December 2021 at 13:00-16:00 (London Time).
