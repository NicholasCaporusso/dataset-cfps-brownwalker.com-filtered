Representations of nature’s agency have become central to many studies conducted in literature, culture studies, philosophy, history, sociology or political science. This conference aims to explore the relationship between the physical environment and text in its broader meaning as well as analyse the social concerns raised by environmental crises. Conference panels will be related, but not limited, to: Sustainable Development Biopolitics Animal Studies Cultural and Literary Ecology Ecolinguistics Ecosophy Ethnobiology Ecofeminism Posthumanism Environmental Arts Environmental History We invite proposals from various disciplines including political sciences, history, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, literature, linguistics, etc. Paper proposals up to 250 words and a brief biographical note should be sent by 20 May 2020 to: eco@lcir.co.uk.
