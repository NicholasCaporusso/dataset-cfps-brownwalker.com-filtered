{"name":"Short Course on Critical Infrastructure (Crit-Is) Energy Supply","series":"","short":"","website":"https://www.wessex.ac.uk/courses/short-course-on-critical-infrastructure-2020","content":"The aim of this course is to introduce energy systems into the infrastructure. Water and food supply, transportation, governments, administrations, health, internet, communication channels, manufacturing of goods, the banking and other sectors essentially depend on energy. Without energy, all these infrastructures cannot be operated. Hence, the energy sector is todayâ€™s most critical infrastructure (Crit-Is). A failure in parts of the energy sector results in negative impact on other infrastructure systems - and may result in situations of disaster.","date_start":"2020-07-01","date_end":"2020-07-03","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Electrical/ Electronic","Power electronics & control"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Ashurst","United Kingdom"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Ashurst","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"United Kingdom"},"organizers":["Wessex Institute"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
