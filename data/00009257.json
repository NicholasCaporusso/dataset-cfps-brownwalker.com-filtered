This conference focuses on innovative applications, tools and platforms in all technology areas such as signal processing, wireless communications, informatics and electronics, related to different kinds of vehicles, including cars, off-road vehicles, trains, ships, underwater vehicles, or flying machines, and the intelligent transportation systems that connect and manage large numbers of vehicles, not only in the context of smart cities but in many other application domains. VEHITS 2017 will be held in conjunction with COMPLEXIS 2017, IoTBDS 2017, CLOSER 2017 and SMARTGREENS 2017\\. Registration to VEHITS allows free access to the COMPLEXIS, IoTBDS, CLOSER and SMARTGREENS conferences (as a non-speaker). CONFERENCE AREAS: Each of these topic areas is expanded below but the sub-topics list is not exhaustive. Papers may address one or more of the listed sub-topics, although authors should not feel limited by them.
