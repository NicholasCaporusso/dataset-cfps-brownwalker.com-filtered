{"name":"2nd International Workshop on Liquid Multi-Device Software","series":"","short":"","website":"http://liquidsoftware.org","content":"In the future, we will use several Web-enabled devices both sequentially and simultaneously. Thus, the users should be able to access applications and resources form multiple devices and in multiple contexts. This means that the applications and data then flow seamlessly from one device or screen to another. Similarly, the ever-increasing set of interconnected devices interact and collaborate, fulfilling the usersâ€™ needs. This coming era raises expectations for interoperability and adaptability. It also calls for new architectures and design principles. The open and modern Web technologies are in the core of this development, since they are vendor neutral and work on every device. Our workshop will discuss various aspects of the implementation the above vision in the context of Web technologies, architectures and applications. Last year the workshop was among the most popular ones, and now this theme is even more timely. The expected topics include use cases, example applications, frameworks for multi-device applications, new programming paradigms, data synchronization techniques, adaptation techniques and novel UI concepts. The workshop invites full research papers and technical demos with short paper.","date_start":"2017-06-05","date_end":"","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2017-06-05","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Engineering & Technology","Computer/Informatics","IOT Internet of Things (IoT)"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Rome","Italy"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Rome","state":"","ZIP":"","country":"Italy"},"organizers":["Nokia"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
