Information is pervasive in many areas of human activity – perhaps all – and complexity is a characteristic of current Exabyte-sized, highly connected and hyper dimensional, information systems. COMPLEXIS 2016 is expected to provide an overview of the state of the art as well as upcoming trends, and to promote discussion about the potential of new methodologies, technologies and application areas of complex information systems, in the academic and corporate world. Conference Areas: Each of these topic areas is expanded below but the sub-topics list is not exhaustive. Papers may address one or more of the listed sub-topics, although authors should not feel limited by them. Unlisted but related sub-topics are also acceptable, provided they fit in one of the following main topic areas: 1\\. COMPLEXITY IN INFORMATICS, AUTOMATION AND NETWORKING 2\\. COMPLEXITY IN BIOLOGY AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING 3\\. COMPLEXITY IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE 4\\.
