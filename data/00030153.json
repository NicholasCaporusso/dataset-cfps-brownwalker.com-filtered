The Bench conference has two essential duties: promote data or benchmark-based quantitative approaches to tackle multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary challenges; connect architecture, system, data management, algorithm, and application communities to better co-design for the inherent workload characterizations. The Bench conference provides a high-quality, single-track forum for presenting results and discussing ideas that further the knowledge and understanding of the benchmarks, data, standards, measurements, and optimizations community as a whole. It is a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary conference. The past meetings attracted researchers and practitioners from the architecture, system, algorithm, and application communities. It includes both invited sessions and contributed sessions. Regularly, the Bench conference will present the BenchCouncil Achievement Award ($3000), the BenchCouncil Rising Star Award ($1000), the BenchCouncil Best Paper Award ($1000), and the BenchCouncil Distinguished Doctoral Dissertation Awards in Computer Architecture ($1000) and in other areas ($1000). This year, the BenchCouncil Distinguished Doctoral Dissertation Award includes two tracks: computer architecture and other areas. Among the submissions of each track, four candidates will be selected as finalists. They will be invited to give a 30-minute presentation at the Benchâ€™22 Conference and contribute research articles to BenchCouncil Transactions on Benchmarks, Standards and Evaluation. Finally, for each track, one among the four will receive the award for each track, which carries a $1,000 honorarium.

Paper Submission ------------------------ Papers must be submitted in PDF. For a full paper, the page limit is 15 pages in the LNCS format, not including references. For a short paper, the page limit is 8 pages in the LNCS format, not including references. The submissions will be judged based on the merit of the ideas rather than the length. The reviewing process is double-blind. Upon acceptance, the proceeding will be published by Springer LNCS (Indexed by EI). Please note that the LNCS format is the final one for publishing. Distinguished papers will be recommended to and published by the BenchCouncil Transactions on Benchmarks, Standards and Evaluation (TBench). At least one author must pre-register for the symposium, and at least one author must attend the symposium to present the paper. Papers for which no author is pre-registered will be removed from the proceedings.
