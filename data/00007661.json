{"name":"Pacific Conference on the Science and Art of Business","series":"","short":"","website":"http://www.thinksisu.org/business","content":"The practice of managing an organization sometimes seems more a science, with decisions and strategies developed through reliance upon general principles and rigorously designed models. Other times it seems more an art, relying upon personal characteristics such as intuition, imagination or personality to achieve specific goals. Moreover, both the science and the art often are concentrated in one functional area of business, such as marketing or finance or logistics, without sufficient consideration of the interplay across functional areas. We welcome presentations on any aspect of business or organizational management, especially those that provide insights that cut across functional boundaries, based upon theories, empirical analyses or case studies.","date_start":"2016-05-06","date_end":"2016-05-08","important_dates":{"abstract":"","full":"2016-04-01","notification":"","final":""},"topics":["Business","Management / Leadership","Business Management & Leadership"],"location":{"virtual":"","full":["Palm Springs","California","United States"],"name":"","street":"","city":"Palm Springs","state":"California","ZIP":"","country":"United States"},"organizers":["The Sisu Advantage"],"societies":[],"indexes":[],"emails":[]}
